I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty. Wow! Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy.' Cause he was just so darn cute. No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses. Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it. Or you just do it. I did do it, I'm a professional. Then what's the problem? See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says' good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing Ooh. Hey, what did your agent say? Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I got ta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me. What, forget it! Yeah, right. Come on, I need your help here. All right. I'll do it, I kissed Joey Tribbiani before I can do it again. You see this, this is a friend. Uh-huh, let's go. Oh, wait I have gum. Okay. Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend. Then I do n't know what it is. What's the problem? Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on. Yeah, that makes sense. Over my dead body! And I'll be using his dead body as a shield. Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good! Tell her Rachel Green looks good, tell Rachel Green Rachel Green looks good. Oh my God, you look so good! I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous. So do n't, I do n't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding. Because I promised Mindy I would. Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry Barry. Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid - of - Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself. Ooh - oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action? I may have. Woo - hoo, stuud! What's Chandler's date look like? Well, we have n't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet. Woo - hoo, geeek! I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy... Get out! Nooo! Please! Well Chandler's date totally called me on it, okay. Chandler's date said,' cut it out, get real', and I did. Wow! What's that like? It's like this, me, no jokes. All right, stop it, you're freaking me out. Oh, yeah, I do n't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later. Bye, Richard. Bye sweetie, I love you. I love you, too. I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gon na be like. What are you talking about? What wedding? Come on, like you never talk that. Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on' Where is this going?' Afraid to ask Richard? Could not be more terrified. Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum. Where's Benny? There he is! Where's Benny, there Ben is. Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out. Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. Okay. Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future? Sure I do. Yeah, am I in it? Honey, you are in it. Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky. Oh, yeah! Keep talkin'. Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast. Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner? Like a hound? Not a basset, a bassinet. You really need the bassinet? Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you, do you not see kids in our future. Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just do n't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start. Uh-huh. Look I want you, now. That's Great. You know we do n't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet. Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much. Just one kiss, I wo n't tell anyone. Joey, no means no! Hey! I'm sorry we, we do n't have your sheep. Aww, Rach, I think you look cute And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon. Get away from me I said no! Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs. Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him Bye. Bye, good luck. So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that. Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words. What does she mean by HH? It means we're holding hands. Are you the cutest? I'm afraid I might just be. You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy. Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her. It could be like a big giant guy. Man, I got this close to Richard and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on? We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl. Oh, well. Just ask her how long Chandler's date's gon na live. Women live longer than men. How do you not fall down more? Okay, ask Chandler's date' What is Chandler's date current method of birth control?' All right. \" My husband is sleeping with his secretary. \" She's married! Well at least we know Chandler's date's a woman. I ca n't believe Chandler's date's married. Aw, man I'm sorry. This must be very tough for ya, huh. So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them. Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about. Neither am I. Hey, there. Hi. Are you all right? Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I should n't be here, you know I should n't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time. Sweetie, it's be gon na okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride. God I know, you're right. All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you. Okay, I'll see you after the thing. Okay, good luck Thank you, Okay, Okay. Why the hell did n't you tell me! I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout' Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!' Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes. Rach, hey look, I remember that, it was n't so bad. Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you. Rachel! Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg. It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much. You told me you did n't see anything. I tell ya a lot things! Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear. Stay well. Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today. Rach! Rach! Oh, hi! Oh my God, I'm married! I know. I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber. Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min. Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now. Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about? Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of.... insane. Insane!... from the syphilis. What?! Yeah, what are they gon na say you did n't love me anymore. Come on. Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him..... Hello? Hello? Are n't you gon na answer her, that's like the tenth bing - bong message she sent. Chandler's date wants to know what's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong. Oh, my. What? Chandler's date wants to meet you in person. Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet Chandler's date in person too, okay, but Chandler's date's married, she has a husband. What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you do n't get chances like this all the time, if you do n't meet Chandler's date now, you're gon na be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip. Okay, I'll do it! Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet Chandler's date! Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower,' cause, eww. No, you know what you have to answer her, answer Chandler's date first. No, no, you know what make some coffee'cause its too much. Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gon na get it in this time, I will. Okay, last chance. Again, I'm sorry. You know what, maybe I do n't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do. Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you. I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel... What?! What, you hired the same band I ca n't use the same speech. Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel... What. No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that... Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding? Most of you do n't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend. Oh dear God. Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because Rachel Green had syphilis. What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that Rachel Green did n't love Barry, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me Cheers. She you in the parking lot. No, Rach! And once again Rachel Green is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um? Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gon na leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least * one * of your weddings. See now, tonight, all I really wanted was to make it though this evening with a little bit of grace and dignity. Well, I guess we can all agree that's not gon na happen. There's nothing really left to say except.... \" Lola name was Lola. Lola was a showgirl. With yellow feathers, feathers in her hair, and a dress cut down to there. Lola would... \" Marenge, \"... marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha - cha. And while Lola like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.. \" Everybody! At the Copa, Copa Cabana The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo - pa Ca - ban - a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa.... Okay, I'll do it. You'll do what? If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is. Oh my God! If I have to I'll, I'll do all again, I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team. Really? Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I do n't wan na lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will. You're the most wonderful man. And if you had n't of said' if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying' okay, let's do it.' But you're not. Oh my God, I ca n't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wan na have a baby, but I do n't wan na have one with someone who does n't really wan na have one. God. I love you. I know you do. Me too. So what now? I guess we just keep dancing. Where is she, Where is she? Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she? Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here. Ooh, oh, oh, that's her. Yeah,'cause life's just that kind. Chandler, you got ta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gon na boil. I think what you have to do is try not to... Oh my God! OH..... MY..... GAWD!! OH..... MY..... GOD!! All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wan na be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes. Wow, you are a good friend,' course the audition was this morning, and I did n't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl. \n","There's nothing to tell! Paul's just some guy I work with! C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's got ta be something wrong with him! All right Joey, be nice. So does Paul have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? Just,' cause, I do n't want Monica Geller to go through what I went through with Carl - oh! Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and - not having sex. Sounds like a date to me. Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked. Oh, yeah. Had that dream. Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there. Instead of...? That's right. Never had that dream. No. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I do n't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. And they were n't looking at you before?! Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very - very weird, because - she never calls me! Hi. This guy says hello, I wan na kill myself. Are you okay, sweetie? I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. Ohh. Let me get you some coffee. Thanks. Ooh! Oh! No, no do n't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? Fine! Be murky! I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. No you do n't. No I do n't, to hell with her, she left me! And you never knew Carol Willick was a lesbian... No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She did n't know, how should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud? I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well. Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \" I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren. \" was what? A wrong number? Sorry. Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! I do n't want to be single, okay? I just... I just - I just wan na be married again! And I just want a million dollars! Rachel?! Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you were n't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! Can I get you some coffee? De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and - you remember my brother Ross? Hi, sure! Hi. So you wan na tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden - Sweet' n' Lo? - I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me : how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering' Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just did n't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. Who was n't invited to the wedding. Ooh, I was kinda hoping that would n't be an issue... Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. Tuna or egg salad? Decide! I'll have whatever Christine is having. Daddy, I just... I ca n't marry him! I'm sorry. I just do n't love him. Well, it matters to me! If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. Ooh, Woman 1 should not be wearing those pants. I say push Woman 1 down the stairs. Push her down the stairs! Push Woman 1 down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me,' You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said,' What if I do n't wan na be a shoe? What if I wan na be a - a purse, y'know? Or a - or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha - It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where Leonard Green'd have trouble. Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica... Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I do n't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!! Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things... Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and - something with mittens... La la la la... something and noodles with string. These are a few... I'm all better now. I helped! Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole,' hat' thing. And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And Chandler Bing's away a lot. Joey, stop hitting on Rachel Green! It's Rachel Green wedding day! What, like there's a rule or something? Please do n't do that again, it's a horrible sound. It's, uh, it's Paul. Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz Paul in! Who's Paul? Paul the Wine Guy, Paul? Maybe. Joey : Wait. Your' not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy? He finally asked you out? Yes! Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment. Rach, wait, I can cancel... Please, no, go, that'd be fine! Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? That'd be good... Really? No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy! What does that mean? Does Paul sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is..... everybody, everybody, this is Paul. Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey! I'm sorry, I did n't catch your name. Paul, was it? Okay, umm - umm, I'll just -- I'll be right back, I just got ta go ah, go ah... A wandering? Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds. Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That ca n't be good. Hey, Paul! Yeah? Here's a little tip, Monica Geller really likes it when you rub Monica Geller neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red. Shut up, Joey! So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight? Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your - - big lizards... Anyway, if you do n't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. Yes, and we're very excited about it. Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gon na hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day. Okay, sure. Hey Pheebs, you wan na help? Oh, I wish I could, but I do n't want to. Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love... is like a giant pigeon... crapping on my heart. La - la - la - la - la - Thank you. La - la - la - la... ohhh! I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and - I can not feel my legs. I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here. It's a beautiful thing. What's this? I would have to say that is an' L' - shaped bracket. Which goes where? I have no idea. Done with the bookcase! All finished! This was Carol's favorite beer. Carol Willick always drank it out of the can, I should have known. Hey - hey - hey - hey, if you're gon na start with that stuff we're outta here. Yes, please do n't spoil all this fun. Ross, let me ask you a question. Carol Willick got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV - what did you get? You guys. Oh, God. You got screwed. Oh my God! Oh my God! I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that right now, Ross Geller's such a mess. How did you get through it? Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her - - leg? That's one way! Me, I - I went for the watch. You actually broke her watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I - I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel. Ooh, steer clear of you. That's right. Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it is n't... it is n't, it's about me, and I ju - Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway... look, look, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel, but it is n't me, it's not me. And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but you just have to give me a chance too... I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced! Shut up! You must stop! That only took me an hour. Look, Ross, you got ta understand, between us we have n't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we do n't do it! I do n't think that was my point! You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman - and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman - for her... What are you talking about?' One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lem me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get' em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! I honestly do n't know if I'm hungry or horny. Stay out of my freezer! Ever since Paul's ex-girlfriend walked out on me, I, uh... What?..... What, you wan na spell it out with noodles? No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation. Oh, so there is gon na be a fifth date? Is n't there? Yeah... yeah, I think there is. - What were you gon na say? Well, ever - ev -... ever since Paul's ex-girlfriend left me, um, I have n't been able to, uh, perform.... Sexually. Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry... It's okay... I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long? Two years. Wow! I'm - I'm - I'm glad you smashed her watch! So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?... Yeah. Yeah, I do. We are gathered here today to join Joanne Louise Cunningham and Charles, Chachi - Chachi - Chachi, Arcola in the bound of holy matrimony. Oh... see... but Joanne loved Chachi! That's the difference! Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words' Billy, do n't be a hero' mean anything to you? Great story! But, I uh, I got ta go, I got a date with Andrea -- Angela -- Andrea... Oh man, Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats. Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here. Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to - to ask a woman out,... who am I gon na ask? Is n't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life. That is amazing. Congratulations. Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there is n't anything I ca n't do. If can invade Poland, there is n't anything I ca n't do. Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you got ta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry... Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here. Morning. Good morning. Morning. Morning, Paul. Hello, Paul. Hi, Paul, is it? Thank you! Thank you so much! Stop! No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness. We'll talk later. Yeah. Thank you. That was n't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up, and put my table back. Okayyy! All right, kids, I got ta get to work. If I do n't input those numbers,... it does n't make much of a difference... So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff. Yeah, I'm an actor. Wow! Would I have seen you in anything? I doubt it. Mostly regional work. Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park. Look, it was a job all right?' Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.' I will not take this abuse. You're right, I'm sorry. \" Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy... \" You should both know, that Chandler Bing's a dead man. Oh, Chandler? So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I ca n't stop smiling. I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. I know, Paul's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco? Oh, yeah. Well, it's like that. With feelings. Oh wow. Are you in trouble. Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used. I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gon na get up and go to work. Oh, look, wish me luck! What for? I'm gon na go get one of those job things. Hey, Monica! Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? You had sex, did n't you? How do you do that? Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who? You know Paul? Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. Of course it was a line! Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that? I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than' to get you into bed'. I hate men! I hate men! Oh no, do n't hate, you do n't want to put that out into the universe. Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear? All right, c'mere, gim me your feet. I just thought he was nice, y'know? I ca n't believe you did n't know it was a line! Guess what? You got a job? Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today. And yet you're surprisingly upbeat. You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off! Oh, how well you know me... They're my new' I do n't need a job, I do n't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots! How'd you pay for them? Uh, credit card. And who pays for that? Um... my... father. Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary? I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want. C'mon, you ca n't live off your parents your whole life. I know that. That's why I was getting married. Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. Thank you. You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I did n't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. The word you're looking for is' Anyway'... All right, you ready? No. No, no, I'm not ready! How can I be ready? \" Hey, Rach! You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute? \" Come on, I ca n't do this! You can, I know you can! I do n't think so. Come on, you made coffee! You can do anything! C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... Y'know what? I think we can just leave it at that. It's kinda like a symbolic gesture... Rachel! That was a library card! Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.. Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gon na love it! Well, that's it You gon na crash on the couch? No. No, I got ta go home sometime. You be okay? Yeah. Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. What? That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. Goodnight. Mmm. Oh, no - Sorry - No no no, go - No, you have it, really, I do n't want it - Split it? Okay. Okay. You know you probably did n't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you. I knew. You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother. I did. Oh. Listen, do you think - and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here - but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe? Yeah, maybe... Okay... okay, maybe I will... Goodnight. Goodnight. See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you? I just grabbed a spoon. I ca n't believe what I'm hearing here. I ca n't believe what I'm hearing here... What? I - I said you had a - What I said you had... Would you stop? Oh, was I doing it again? Yes! I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt. Oh, you would n't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya. There's an image. Would anybody like more coffee? Did you make it, or are you just serving it? I'm just serving it. Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee. Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. Ahh, miss? More coffee? Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there? Go ahead. Thank you. Sorry. Okay, Las Vegas. Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli - \n","What you guys do n't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. Yeah, right!....... Y'serious? Oh, yeah! Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. Absolutely. Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand - up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. Yeah, and - and it's not that we do n't like the comedian, it's that - that... that's not why we bought the ticket. The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. Yeah, well, word of advice : Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gon na find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone..... Are we still talking about sex? No, it's good, it is good, it's just that - mm - does n't she seem a little angry? Well, she has issues. Does Woman 1. Man 1's out banging other women over the head with a club, while Woman 1 sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like' Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? Speaking of issues, is n't that your ex-wife? No. No. Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. Hi. So. You look great. I, uh... I hate that. Sorry. You look good too. Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... A lesbian? Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh - Why - why are you here, Carol? I'm pregnant. Pregnant?! Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.... Then I've already seen this one! Are you through with that? Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. Whose little ball of paper is this?! Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I did n't need it, so I balled it up and...... now I wish I was dead. Monica Geller's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that - - but, it's fine! Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just do n't wan na give them any more ammunition than they already have. Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. Monica - Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not - not in a good way. Yeah, calm down. You do n't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, Ross Geller's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! What? Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! Eeaagh! Has anybody seen my engagement ring? Yeah, it's beautiful. Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... No, look, do n't touch that! Oh, like I was n't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to Barry...' Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gon na have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... Easy Rach, we'll find it. Wo n't we! Oh! Yeah! Alright, when'd'ya have it on last? Doy! Probably right before Rachel Green lost it! You do n't get a lot of' doy' these days... I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...... Dinah? Ohhhhh, do n't be mad... You did n't. Oh, I am sorry... I gave you one job! Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... I just... ca n't do it. Boys? We're going in...... Hi. Wow. That is not a happy hi. Carol's pregnant. Ooh! I found it! W - w - wh -... wha -... w - w - w -... Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? Well now, how - how do you fit into this whole thing? Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I do n't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. She is so great! I miss her. What does she mean by' involved'? I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. Anyway, they want me to go down to this - sonogram thing with them tomorrow. So what are you gon na do? I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gon na be a father...... Well, this is still ruined, right? Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gon na call you. Mmm! What's that curry taste? Curry. Mmmm! I - I think they're great! I, I really do. Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, did n't she? They all had a thing for him. Aw, Mom... I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me? Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I do n't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant - No Mom, I do n't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant. Well, they do n't have to know that... Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please? Yeah. Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy. I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby / lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me. What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well. I'm not gon na tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money! Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar... What's that supposed to mean? Nothing! It's an expression. No it's not. Do n't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles... Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are - I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.... And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God' Our Little Harmonica' does n't seem to have that problem. So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories? No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks? Okay! Okay. Look, I, uh - I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby. And you knew about this?! Your folks are really that bad, huh? Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. Boy, I know they say you ca n't change your parents,... boy, if you could - - I'd want yours. Must pee. Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. You're twins? Yeah. We do n't speak. Ursula's like this high - powered, driven career type. What does Ursula do? Ursula's a waitress. All right, you guys, I kinda got ta clean up now. Chandler, you're an only child, right? You do n't have any of this. Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. The lights, please..... How long was I in there? I'm just cleaning up. D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! Anyway.. um.. So, you - uh - you nervous about Barry tomorrow? Oh.. a little.. Mm-hmm.. A lot. Mm. So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been - dumped? Well, you may wan na steer clear of the word' dumped'. Chances are he's gon na be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB / GYN... Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? Got me. Remember when we were in high school together? Yeah. I mean, did n't you think you were just gon na meet somone, fall in love - and that'd be it?.. Ross? Yes, yes! Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. Me either... Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. Hi. Ross, you remember Susan. How could I forget? Ross. Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? Dr. Oberman... Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he - Dr. Oberman. - Dr. Oberman, of course, Dr. Oberman - uh - familiar with our.. special situation? Yes, and Dr. Oberman's very supportive. Okay, that's great. No, I'm - Oh. Thanks. Quack, quack.. Ross? That opens my cervix. Barry? C'mon in. Are you sure? Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gon na be here for hours. Huh?! So, how ya doin? I'm - uh - I'm okay... You look great! Yeah, well.. Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging. Be right there. Be back in a sec. I dumped him. Okay. So, um - so how's this, uh, how's this gon na work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? Give me a' for instance'. Well, uh, uh, I do n't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? Marlon - Marlon?! - if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.... As in Mouse? As in my grandmother. Still, you - you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? Julia.. We agreed on Minnie.' S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? Oh, not much. I - I got a job. Oh, that's great. Why are - why are you so tanned? Oh, I, uh - I went to Aruba. Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt. Me?! No! I went with Mindy. Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs! Careful! They have n't quite taken yet. And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. Okay.. See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. Wow. You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We were n't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. What? Me. Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me. Well, thank you for giving it back. Hello?! Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen? Helen Geller? I do n't think so. Hello? It's not gon na be Helen Geller. Thank you! No, I mean it's not Geller. What, it's gon na be Helen Willick? No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick - Bunch. Well, wait a minute, wha - why is she in the title? It's my baby too. Oh,' s'funny, really? Um, I do n't remember you making any sperm. Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is! All right, you two, stop it! No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick - Bunch - Geller?' Cause I think that borders on child abuse. Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller - Willick - Bunch. Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no - one's gon na say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way! My way?! You - you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way - y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I ca n't do - Knock knock! How are we today? Any nausea? Yeah. Yeah. A little. Well, I was just wondering about the mother - to - be, but.. thanks for sharing. Uh, lie back.. You - uh - y'know what, I'm gon na go. I do n't - I do n't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. Oh my God. Look at that. I know. Well? Is n't that amazing? What are we supposed to be seeing here? I du n no, but.. I think it's about to attack the Enterprise. You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato. Then do n't do that, alright? Okay! Monica. Whaddya think? Mm-hmm. Wh - are you welling up? No. You are, you're welling up. Am not! You're gon na be an aunt. Oh shut up! Hi, Mindy. Hi, it - it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I - I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he - he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if - if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids - and everything - I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose. Okay, I know it was a cheap shot, but I feel so much better now. \n","Hi guys! Hey, Pheebs! Hi! Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said' We should do this again!' Ohh. Ouch. What? Phoebe's boyfriend said' we should do it again', that's good, right? Uh, no. Loosely translated' We should do this again' means' You will never see me naked'. Since when? Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like' It's not you' means' It is you'. Or' You're such a nice guy' means' I'm gon na be dating leather - wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. Or, or, y'know, um,' I think we should see other people' means' Ha, ha, I already am'. And everybody knows this? Yeah. Cushions the blow. Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. Uh, Ross. What? Wh - hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was - it w -..... Oh my God, Chi Chi! \" So how does it feel knowing you're about to die? \" \" Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die. \" Hey, that was really good! Thanks! Let's keep going. Okay. \" So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh? \" \" I just wan na go back to my cell.' Cause in my cell, I can smoke. \" \" Smoke away. \" I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone. What? Relax your hand! Not so much! Whoah! Hey! Hey! Alright, now try taking a puff. Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me. No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette. It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wan na get this part, or not? Here. Do n't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete. Y'miss it? Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke. Oh.. my.. God. No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger. That's ridiculous! Can I use.. either thumb? Alright, do n't tell me, do n't tell me! Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this! Yeah. Yeah, excellent. Good for me! Y'okay, Phoebe? Yeah - no - I'm just - it's, I have n't worked - It's my bank. What did they do to you? It's nothing, it's just - Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT - Easy. - and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account. Oh, Satan's minions at work again... Yes,'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them. What are you talking about? Keep it! It's not mine, I did n't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing. Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping! Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took?' Not - mine. Not - mine. Not - mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping -' Not - not - mine, not - not - mine, not - not - mine, not - not - mine'... We're with you. We got it. Okay. I'd - just - I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt. Chandler, what are you doing? Hey. Whaddya doing? Oh! Oh, God! What is this?! I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking. Oh, I ca n't believe you! You've been so good, for three years! And this - is my reward! Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit. Okay, so this time I wo n't quit! Ohhh! Put it out! All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. Oh, no! I - I ca n't drink this now! Alright. I'm gon na go change, I've got a date. This Alan again? How's it goin'?' S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun. So when do we get to meet the guy? Let's see, today's Monday... Never. Oh, come on! Come on! No. Not after what happened with Steve. What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry. Look, I do n't even know how I feel about Alan yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out. Well, then can we meet Alan? Nope. Schhorry. I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over Alan. I mean, they're like - coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd. Listen. As someone who's seen more than Paula fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you : that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you. I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked. Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.. Let it go, Ross. Yeah, well, you did n't know Chi Chi. Do you all promise? Yeah! We promise! We'll be good! Chandler? Do you promise to be good? You can come in, but your filter - tipped little buddy has to stay outside! Hey, Pheebs.' Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this - - football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! What bank is this? Hey. It's him. Who is it? It's Alan. Chandler! Alan's here! Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me. Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan. Hi. Hi, Alan. I've heard schho much about all you guyschh! Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan - bashing begin. Who's gon na take the first shot, hmm? C'mon!... I'll go. Let's start with the way Alan kept picking at - no, I'm sorry, I ca n't do this, ca n't do this. We loved Alan. Loved Alan! Yeah! He's great! Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with? Yeah! And did you notice...? Yeah. Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked. Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!... What shoe? From the nursery rhyme.' There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'... So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured. What future boyfriends? Nono, I th - I think this could be, y'know, it. Really! Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gon na be doing that at parties, right? You know what I like most about Alan, though? What? The way he makes me feel about myself. Yeah... Hi.. how was the game? Well.. WE WON!! Thank you! Yes! Fantastic! I have one question : How is that possible? Alan. He was unbelievable. He was like that - that - that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base - Alan, second base - Alan, third base -... I mean, it - it was like, it was like Alan made us into a team. Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.. Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes.. What?.. I du n no, a little too Alan? Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan. Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan - ness that - that - that we adore. I personally could have a gallon of Alan. Hey, Lizzie. Hey, Weird Girl. I brought you alphabet soup. Did you pick out the vowels? Yes. But I left in the Ys.' Cause, y'know, \" sometimes y \". Uh, I also have something else for you. Saltines? No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone? What? Oh my God, there's really money in here. I know. Weird Girl, what are you doing? No, I want you to have it. I do n't want it. No, no, I ha - I have to give you something. Oh, that's fine, no. Would you like my tin - foil hat? No.' Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks. Please, let me do something. Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay? Okay. Okay. Keep the change. Sure you do n't wan na pretzel? No, I'm fine. See ya. Huh! A thumb?! Eww! I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch - hiker! Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five? Does, um, anyone wan na see? Nooo! Oh, hey, do n't do that! Cut it out! It's worse than the thumb! Hey, this is so unfair! Oh, why is it unfair? So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle - cracking is n't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when Monica Geller laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing?... I accept all those flaws, why ca n't you accept me for this?... Does the knuckle - cracking bother everybody? Well, I - I could live without it. Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair? Oh, now, do n't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing. Oh, \" you do, do you \"? You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly. \" Indeed there is n't \"... I should really get back to work. Yeah,'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered. Ohh - ho - hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on. Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like? No. Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through! Can you believe it?... Y'know what? I just do n't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I do n't feel the thing. Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him! I know.. it's gon na be really hard. Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it. No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about. Do you have any respect for your body? Do n't you realise what you're - you're doing to yourself? Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it. Chandler? It's Alan, Alan wants to speak to you. Really? He does? Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, Rachel Green told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big -.. well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no - one - no - one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks! God, Chandler Bing's good. If only Chandler Bing were a woman. Yeah. Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too. Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. Hey. Where's Joey? Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I killed him. Do you think that was wrong? I think he's across the hall. Thanks. There y'go. Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now. Hey Pheebs, you gon na have the rest of that Pop - Tart?.. Pheebs? Does anyone want the rest of this Pop - Tart? Hey, I might! Sorry... Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb. You're kidding. Oh my God. And on my way over here, I stepped in gum.... What is up with the universe?! What's going on? Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together. Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear.. Uh, Joey.. Oh, God! Okay.. Oh! That was Lambchop! Please, guys, we have to talk. Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu... no, I'm not. Alright, we have to talk. There it is! Okay. It's - it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan. Is there somebody else? No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change. We did n't change.. So that's it? It's over? Just like that? You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just - I - Look, I - I could go on pretending - Okay! - but that would n't be fair to me, it would n't be fair to Alan - It would n't be fair to you! Who - who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were. I'm sorry.. Oh, she's sorry! I feel better! I just ca n't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up - I wanted him to meet my family - I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans. Oh, yeah! Right! Are you guys gon na be okay? Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gon na need a little time. I understand. Wow. I'm, I'm really sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I got ta tell you, I am a little relieved. Relieved? Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just ca n't stand your friends. Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun. Yeah. He could row like a viking. Hi. Mmm. So how'd it go? Oh, y'know.. Did he mention us? He said he's really gon na miss you guys. You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere.... That's it. I'm getting cigarettes. No no no! I do n't care, I do n't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've got ta smoke! I've got ta have the smoke! If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars! Yeah, alright. \n","Alright. Phoebe? Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain - forest... And bigger boobs! Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you? Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever. See, there's always one guy. \" If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes. \" Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy. Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent? Probably kill myself!.. Excuse me? Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live! Joey, uh - OMnipotent. You are? Ross, I'm sorry.. How does Phoebe Buffay do that? I can not sleep in a public place. Would you look at Phoebe Buffay? Phoebe Buffay is so peaceful. Oh! What what what!... Hi. It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again. What's going on with you? I got no sleep last night! Why? My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are! Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight. Thanks.... Ninety - five, ninety - six, ninety - seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here. You got waaaay too much free time. Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out : hockey tickets, Rangers - Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you. Happy birthday, pal! We love you, man. Funny, my birthday was seven months ago. So? So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and could n't decide which one of you got to bring a date? Well, are n't we Mr. \" The glass is half empty. \" Oh my God, oh - is today the twentieth, October twentieth? Oh, I was hoping you would n't remember. Ohhh. What's wrong with the twentieth? Eleven days before Halloween.. all the good costumes are gone? Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship. Sex... You know what, I - I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gon na go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover. The hell with hockey, let's all do that! C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy, Huh? Huh? Huh? What are you doing? I have no idea. C'mon, Ross! Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger? You got it. Look - look - look - look - look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were killed. Wow, you worked in a mine? I worked in a Dairy Queen, why? God, is n't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what - Chandler, look at that. Oh, this is not that bad. Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job. You can totally, totally live on this. Yeah, yeah. Oh, by the way, great service tonight. Oh! Yeah! Hockey! Hockey! Hockey. Rachel? Oh my God! I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom. What are you guys doing here? Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true! Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play. Look at you, you are so big I ca n't believe it! I know. I know! I'm a duplex. So what's going on with you? Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? And while we're on the subject of news.. Look, look, I have elbows!... Poulet passes it up to Leetch! Leetch spots Messier in the crease - there's the pass! We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes. Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we - we first - y'know. Fact, Carol Willick, uh - she never took'em off,'cause we - we - Sorry. Sorry. What? Peach pit. Yes, Bunny? Peach pit. That night we, uh - we had - - Peaches? Actually, nectarines, but basically... Could've been a peach. Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I - I... I walked Carol Willick to the - - the bus stop... I'm fine. Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's! What? Thought we were trying to find stuff. So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt! Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar! Alright. Let's talk reality for a second. Okay. When are you coming home? What? Guys, I'm not. C'mon, this is us. I'm not!

How was it with your friends? Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? What's that? Weeeell, it's rum, and - Okay. We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister... Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we ca n't operate. But we can prep the guy! Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people. Oh, God, ask them what they want. Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? Yes, hold on. Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account. But I have n't used my card in weeks! That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wan na see if you're okay. They wan na know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wan na know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay? Uh - Rachel has left the building, can you call back? Alright, c'mon! Let's play Twister! Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh. What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost... C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit. You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing! Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what? You are just like Jack.... Jack from downstairs? No, Jack and the Beanstalk. Ah, the other Jack. Yeah, right! See, Jack 1 gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then Jack 1 woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And Jack 1 lived in a village, and you live in the Village.. Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I did n't love him - Oh, see, Jack did love the cow. But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like... Floopy? Yeah. So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we do n't know where we're going. You've just got ta figure at some point it's all gon na come together, and it's just gon na be... un-floopy. Oh, like that's a word. Okay, but Monica, what if - what if it does n't come together?... Pheebs? Oh, well...' cause.... you just... I do n't like this question.

It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied. Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room. Hold on. Fill these out, sit over there. Look, I do n't wan na make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented. Well, you'll have to wait your turn. Well, how long do you think it'll be? Any minute now. Hey, this - Heyy... I'm so sorry, you guys. I did n't mean to bring you down. No, you were right. I do n't have a plan. Pizza guy! Thank God. Food. Phoebe? What? Do you have a plan? I do n't even have a' pl'. Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?

This one goes across the street, I must have given George Stephanopoulos yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead! Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?

Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza - Hey, that's not for you, bitch! Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with? Oh, c'mon Dora, do n't be mad... I know we both said some things we did n't mean, but that does n't mean we still do n't love each other. Y'know, I feel like I've lost her.. Ba -! Light still out? Yeah. Oh. Maybe they're - napping. Oh please, they're having sex. Shut up! So, whaddya think George is like? I think he's shy. Yeah? Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then - when you do - he's a preppy animal. I remember the moonlight coming through the window - and her face had the most incredible glow. Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part - Could I get some painkillers over here, please? He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that. Look, it's just a little more complicated... Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That Carol Willick likes women? That Carol Willick left you for another woman that likes women? Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that did n't quite hear you... Then what? My first time with Carol was... What? It was my first time. With Carol? Oh. So in your whole life, you've only been with one oh. Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! Okay. Okay, I got one.

Anyway - The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me. Excuse me?! Hello? Like he was really gon na send you one? She was a big girl. Really.

Oh, George, baby, drop the towel! Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the wowww. Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman? I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic... Really? No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. Hey, buddy. Hi. Oh, that's attractive. Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it!

To the left, to the left - aww! Ohhh... I'm fine. \n","Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal. Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right? Come on! You guys can pee standing up. We can? All right, I'm tryin' that. Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me. Oh, ok, you know what I do n't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care. Multiple orgasms! So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat - ur - day night! No plans, huh? Not a one. Not even, say, breaking up with Janice? Oh, right, right, shut up. Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just got ta do it. No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note. Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling. You know, if you want, I'll do it with you. Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her. No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony. Tony? Oh, you're breaking up with Tony? Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I do n't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I do n't know. Does anybody want anything else? Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing. Nothing, just, just, I'm fine. What's the matter? Why so scrunchy? It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible. That guy, he burns me up. Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady. Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that. Did he give you that whole \" You're - not - up - to - this \" thing again? Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of \" You'll never make it on your own \". Uh-huh, uh-huh. Hi, Joey. My god, Angela. Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her. Are you gon na go over there? No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I do n't wan na seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool. Hey, Angela. Joey. You look good. That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs. You do n't say. So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight? Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama. Oh, you uh, you wan na hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too? Who? Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why do n't, um, why do n't I just join you both, here? Do n't you have a laundry room in your building? Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish? Sure. Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now. Bob? Who the hell's Bob? Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob... Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too. Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what? What? We're just friends. Fine, fine, so, why do n't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends? What four of us? You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica. Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you. Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet. Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. Bob's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is... Oh, god help us. What? Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww! Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for Angela Delvecchio brother, maybe Angela will come back to me. What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls. I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with Angela Delvecchio. Will you help me? Please? Ok, bye. Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gon na be me and Rachel. Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through? It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal. It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date. Nuh - uh. Yuh - huh. So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what? Well, you may wan na rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gon na see your underwearyou want it to be dirty? No. Oh, and uh, the fabric softener? Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way. There you go. Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short? Yep. Which? Which what? You've never met Bob, have you? No, but Bob's... Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly... Hey, Joey.... horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now. Where are they? Where are they? This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us. It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies. Eww, I do n't wan na do that. Here we go. Ok, have a good break - up. Hey, Janice. Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day. Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please? We got the proofs back from that photo shoot, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you... What? What? What... did you get me there? I got you... these. Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet. Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky, or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want. That's great. Well, I'm gon na get another espresso. Can I get you another latte? No, no, I'm still working on mine. That's it? Yeah, it was really hard. Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal. Ok, you were n't there. Comin' through. Move, move. Oh,' scuse me. I was kinda using that machine. Yeah, well, now you're kinda not. But I saved it. I put my basket on top. Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I do n't see suds. What? No suds, no save. Ok? What's goin' on? Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine. Was your basket on top? Yeah, but, there were no suds. So? Well, you know, no suds, no save. No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second. That's my friend's machine. Hey, hey, hey, Rachel Green stuff was n't in it. Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it. All right, show's over. Nothing to see here. Ok, let's do laundry. That was amazing. I ca n't even send back soup. Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh... Do you, uh, do you... Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent. What's that? Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough. Rach, do you uh, are you gon na separate those? Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants? Rach, have you never done this before? Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin. Uh, well, do n't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wan na use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things. Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates? Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call. He is so cute. So, where did you guys grow up? Brooklyn Heights. Cleveland. How, how did that happen? Oh my god. What? I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not. So, you and Angela, huh? Yep. Pretty much. You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about Angela Delvecchio? That cute nibbly noise when Angela Delvecchio eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel. Huh, I never really noticed. Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it. Monica, Monica is great. Yeah, but it's not gon na last. Monica Geller's too much for me in bed. Sexually. I've got ta tell you, Bob is terrific. Yeah, is n't Bob? It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight. You know what else? Bob's unbelievable in bed. Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity. Huh. That's nice. Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band - aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed. Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I do n't think we should go out anymore. Janice. All right. Well, there you go. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Ok, I know this is gon na sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there is n't anything I ca n't do. That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me? I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh. What uh-oh? Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing. Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh. Ross, what's the matter? Nothing, nothing. Lee - lo, the laundry's done. Come on, show me. All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink. Oh, everything's pink. Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please do n't be upset, it could happen to anyone. Except it did n't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gon na look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I ca n't live on my own! I ca n't even do laundry! Something went wrong with Underdog, and they could n't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please? Oh my god. What? Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia. Come on, they're close. Close? Woman's got Woman tongue in his ear. Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross. Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it'snot really true, is it? Well, who's to say what's true? I mean... Oh my god, what were you thinking? All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little. Oh! Ow! I'm outta here. Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want Woman. He likes you. Really? Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up. I'm so sorry, I ca n't believe I did this, but I could n't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story. Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here. Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom,... boom. Ow! Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok? Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back. I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break - up in the history of the world. Oh my god. How many of those have you had? Oh, I do n't know, a million? Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la. I'm fine. All right. I'm not fine. Here she comes. Wait here. Breathe. How do you do that? It's like a gift. We should always always break up together. Oh, I'd like that. You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part. Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now. Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart. Yeah, well, I had a 24 - inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way. I'm sorry, you know, maybe I was n't being clear. Uh, this is our cart. Hey, hey, hey there are n't any clothes in it. Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules! Let go! All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gon na have to take me with it! Yes! Did you see that? You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen. I could not have done this without you. Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer? I'm fine, I'm fine. Are you sure? No. Oh, are you sure you're ok? Yeah. Does it still hurt? Yeah. What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gon na do this. Hi. Hey, how'd it go? Excellent. We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves. What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way. Oh, I'm sorry. Where's Chandler? Oh, he needed some time to grieve. I'm free! I'm free! That oughta do it. \n","Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting! You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom... The exclamation point in the title scares me. Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud! Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen. Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. All you want is a dingle, What you envy's a schwang, A thing through which you can tinkle, Or play with, or simply let hang... God. I feel violated. Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do? Ross, ten o'clock. Is it? Feels like two. No, ten o'clock. What? There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock! Oh. Hel - lo! Aurora's amazing! Aurora makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men! Well, go over to her! Aurora's not with anyone. Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be?' Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.' Oh, c'mon. Aurora's a person, you can do it! Oh please, could Aurora be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here. Chandler Bing could never get a woman like that in a million years. Thank you, buddy. Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys. You could do that! Y'think? Yeah! Oh God, I ca n't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue... C'mon! C'mon! Here goes.... Yes? Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh...... hi. Yes, you said that. Yes, yes I did, but what I did n't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight. Chandler? Hey! You're in a play! I did n't know you could dance! You had a beard! Whadja think?... Hey! You're in a play! I did n't know you could dance! You had a beard! C'mon, you guys, it was n't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head. Saw your head. Saw your head. Aurora said yes!! Aurora said yes!! Awful play, man. Whoah. Aurora name's Aurora, and Aurora's Italian, and she pronounces my name' Chand - lrr'.' Chand - lrr'. I think I like it better that way. Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. What is it? The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wan na sign me! Based on this play?... Based on this play! Hey, kids. Hey. No,'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line. Well, I ca n't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you have n't asked me how my date went. Oh, right, right. How was your date,' Chand - lrr'? It was unbelievable. I - I've never met anyone like her. Aurora's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...... Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I -... I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. We talked' til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.... All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. Oh, I'm sorry, so' we' is?' We' would be me and Rick. Who's Rick? Who's Rick? My husband. Ooooohhh. Oh, so you're divorced? No. Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?... Hopefully? No, I'm still married. So tell me, how do - how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?... Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket? Do n't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan. Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan? Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend. What?! So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend? I suppose mainly sexual.... Hm. Oh. I'm sorry it did n't work out. What' not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Did n't you listen to the story? Did n't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this? Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff : all the fun, all the talking, all the sex ; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy! Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy? No, of course not!... Yeah, yeah, it is. What? So you guys do n't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else? I could n't do it. Good for you, Joey. When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking - Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! Yeah! C'mon! Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey - Tah - daaah! Are we greeting each other this way now?' Cause I like that. Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I do n't know what that's for. Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask. Well, whaddya think? Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!... Oh! I - I see you moved the green ottoman. Uh-oh... How - how did that happen? I du n no.. I - I thought it looked better there. And I - and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table. Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot. Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while. I ca n't believe you tried to move the green ottoman. Thank God you did n't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out. You guys, I am not that bad! Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know, Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! That is so unfair! Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that was n't raggedy! Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook. Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you do n't pay it right away. Why not? Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice. I could do that. Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy - pour spout. Why would someone do that?!... One might wonder. Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood... STOP IT!!... Oh my God. It's true! Who am I? Monica? You're Mom. Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there! That was my agent. My agent has just gotten me a job... in the new Al Pacino movie! Oh my God! Whoah! Well, what's the part? Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! \" I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order! \" Seriously, what - what's the part? \" Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in! \" C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?... I'm his.. You're, you're' mah mah mah' what?... I'm his butt double.' Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then - I'm his butt. Oh my God. C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big! Oh no, it's terrific, it's... it's... y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness. Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I do n't care! This is a big break for me! You're right, you're right, it is... So you gon na invite us all to the big opening? Alright, alright, alright... Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer. For what? Whaddya think? Today's the big day! Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just do n't ever tell me what you did in there. Thank you! Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone. He's in the bathroom. I do n't think you wan na go in there! C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!! I warned you... Who is being loud? Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wan na borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wan na make her breakfast. Oh, you got the whole night, huh? Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment? No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.' Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every - single - second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty - five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the - the old Monica would - would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush... But I'm not gon na do that.... Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready? Uh, listen, I just wan na thank you for this great opportunity. Lose the robe. Me? That would work. Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost. Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working.. and... action. And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing? Well, I'm - I'm showering. No, that was clenching. Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here. I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action.... and cut. What was that? I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... God, I love these fingers... Thank you. No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at' em, look at how happy they are. Oh my God, I'm late. Oh no nonononononnononono, do n't go.. Okay. Do n't go. Okay. Oh no, I have to. Too bad, she's leaving. I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me. Well, I thought - I thought you talked to Rick. It's not Rick. What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you! No, it's - it's Andrew. I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but - And Andrew is? Andrew's... new. Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? No, that's not exactly what I was.. Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us. So what do you want? You. You have me! Nono, just you. Whaddyou mean? Lose the other guys.... Like,... all of them? C'mon, we're great together, why not? Why ca n't we just have what we have now? Why ca n't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.... Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going' Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know,' This is too hard! Get out! Get out!' So... which one of the two guys will you listen to? I do n't know, I - I have to listen to both of them, they do n't exactly let each other finish... Which one?... The second guy. Well, call me if you change your mind. Sorry, the first guy runs the lips. Look at it this way : you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again? Hey! Hey, waitwait, are n't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie? Nope. No? What happened, big guy? \" Big guy? \" It felt like a' big guy' moment. I got fired. Oh! Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gon na go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and... Oh, Joey, you know what, no - one is gon na be able to tell. My mom will. Something so sweet and... disturbing about that. Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Maybe this was n't your shot. Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you - you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..? Hard to tell, I was naked. No, I do n't think this was your shot. I mean, I do n't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gon na happen for you, I do! You've got ta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gon na run up to his friends and go' I got the part! I got the part! I'm gon na be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'. Yeah? That's so nice! I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gon na go to bed, guys. Night. Uh, Mon, you - you gon na leave your shoes out here? Uh-huh! Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner? Does n't matter, I'll get' em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. Monica Geller is a kook. If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Do n't do this. This is stupid! I do n't have to prove anything, I'm gon na go get them... But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back!... I need help! \n","Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay. Hi. Um, I want to start with a song that s about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go. OK, thank you very much. Oh, great. This is just... Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out! Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on. Wow, you guys, this is big. Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gon na meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma. What's my number? Well, I never call me. Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre. Hi Mom, it's Jill. Jill's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot! Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule. Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule. I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I do n't know, some guy. Oh! Some guy. Some guy.' Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, Chandler Bing was some guy. Hi everyone. And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani. Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone. Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles. That had to hurt! Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile! There you go! You're definitely scaring here. Would you like to call somebody? Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. Hello? Hey, it's me. It's Chandler! Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr. What? I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr! I have no idea what you just said. Put Joey on the phone. What's up man? I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR. Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Chandler, listen. Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind. Alright, somebody. OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table. Whoooaa! That's my sister. OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library. Oh my God! What were you doing in a library? Pheebs, what about you? Oh... Milwaukee. Um... Ross? Disneyland, 1989,' It's a Small World After All.' No way! The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom. Oh, Rachel. Oh come on, I already went. You did not go! Come on. Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be...... oh, the foot of the bed. Step back. We have a winner! I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park. Well, it was the only thing to do there that did n't have a line. There, well, see? Barry would n't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. Come on. No, Barry said we were holding up the people behind us. And you did n't marry Barry because...? I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of... Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated. Yeah right. It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff. OK. But, um... I do n't think that's going to be you. You do n't. Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future. Really? Mmmm. You do? I do. Oh Ross, you're so great. It's never gon na happen. What? You and Rachel. What? Why not? Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. No, no, no. I'm not in the zone. Ross, you're mayor of the zone. I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to... Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you do n't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever. I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now? Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to Rachel Green and say,' Rachel, I think that...' Shhhh! What are you shushing? We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Do n't you hear that? Ahhhh! See? Huh. Would you like some gum? Um, is it sugarless? Sorry, it's not. Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note : If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you mangled animal carcass, you take it. New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary,'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... OK, here goes. Are you going to do it? I'm going to do it. Do you want any help? You come out there, you're a dead man. Good luck, man. Thanks. OK. OK. Hey, where are you going? Outside. You ca n't go out there. Why not? Because of... the reason. And that would be? I, um, ca n't tell you. Joey, what's going on? OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you. About what? He's planning your birthday party. Oh my God! I love Ross Geller! You'd better act surprised. About what? My surprise party! What surprise party? Oh stop it. Joey already told me. Well, Joey Tribbiani did n't tell me. Hey, do n't look at me. This is Ross's thing. This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything. No, you are not. We tell you stuff. Yuh - huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when Joey Tribbiani was moving in. Looks like I was second to last. Hmmm... this is so nice. OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment. OK. OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um.... Ohhh!!!! Yes, yes, that's right... Oh, look at the little cat! What? Ow! I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since... This is just Bactine. It wo n't hurt. Sorry, that was wax. Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner. Why do n't we just put' poor little Tooty' out in the hall? During a blackout? He'd get trampled! Yeah? You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.' Gum would be perfection'?' Gum would be perfection.' Could have said' gum would be nice,' or' I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself. Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right? Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner. Er, yeah, it's mine. He seems to hate you. Are you sure? Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat. Wait a minute. What's his name? Ehhhh... B - Buttons. Bob Buttons? Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons. Oooh! You are a very bad man! You owe me a cat. Here, kitty - kitty. Here kitty - kitty. Where did you go, little kitty - kitty - kitty? Here kitty - kitty - kitty - kitty... Wow. Lucky sixes.... Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica. Hi! And Joey.... Hi! And Ross. Hi! He does n't speak much English. Monopoly! Look at that! So, um... where did Paolo come from? Oh... Italy, I think. No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives. Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat! That, that is funny....... and Rachel keeps touching him. Alright. I looked all over the building and I could n't find the kitty anywhere. Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat. Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo. Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe. You betcha! Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go. Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. Good save! We're back on track, and I'm..... chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking. Are you alright? My God, you're choking! That better? Yes... thank you. That was... that was.... Perfection? Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah.... Wha - What did he say that was so funny? I have absolutely no idea. That's... that's classic. Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me! If you want, I'll do it. I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip. But I wo n't. God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry. You know, did you ride mopeds?' Cause I've heard...... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK. Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we do n't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd.... Paolo. Hi. Ross! Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing. Thing? Thing, yes. Thing. Ah, you... have the sex? No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um... Bed? No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad. Oh! Yeah! Se vice? Si. So you do know a little English. Poco... a leetle. Do you know the word crapweasel? No. That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel! Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy. OK. Ready? No, you've got to whip it. Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7...... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... Thank you. Thanks. Kinda... spooky without any lights. Bwah - hah - hah! OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo - hah - hah... Oh.. oh... oh. Hey Ross. This probably is n't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica. Well, this has been fun. Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life. Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout. See ya. Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I do n't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape. \n","Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this? Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said' co - dependent', or' self - destructive'... Do you want a date Saturday? Yes please. Okay. Man 1's cute, Man 1's funny, Man 1's - Man 1's a he? Well yeah!... Oh God. I - just - I thought - Good, Shelley. I'm just gon na go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye...... Could n't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that? Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... You did? Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not. Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me? I did. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Not me. Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did. You're kidding! Did you tell Susan Sallidor I was n't? No. No, it's just' cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with Susan Sallidor too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked Susan Sallidor, so... Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me? I du n no,'cause you're smart, you're funny... Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him? Yeah! Right! WHAT IS IT?! Okay, I - I d'know, you - you just - you have a quality. Yes. Absolutely. A quality. Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gon na be vague about this. Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio. So Paolo's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just got ta go to Rome. Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome. Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. So, uh, how's Ross' grandmother doing? The doctor says it's a matter of hours. How - how are you, Mom? Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here.... What's with your hair? What? What's different? Nothing. Oh, maybe that's it. Mrs. Geller is unbelievable, our mother is... Okay, relax, relax. We are gon na be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. Oh God! The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. Oh!... Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Ross' grandmother Sweet' n' Los. How Ross' grandmother was always stealing them from - from restaurants. Not just restaurants, from our house. Mrs. Geller? Ross' grandmother looks so small. I know. Well, at least she's with Pop - Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. G'bye, Nana. Bye, Nana. Ross! What is going on?! Y'know how - how the nurse said that - that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.. What? She's not - past, she's present, Ross' grandmother's back. What's going on? Ross' grandmother may have died. Ross' grandmother may have died? We're looking into it. I, uh, I'll go see. This almost never happens! Now Ross' grandmother's passed. I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair? Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. Yeah, you have homosexual hair. So, um, did she... Twice. Twice? Oh, that sucks! You guys okay? I du n no, it's weird. I mean, I know Ross' date's gone, but I just do n't feel, uh... Maybe that's'cause she's not really gone. Nono, Ross' date's gone. We checked. A lot. Hm, I mean maybe no - one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that Lily Buffay's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high - got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course - I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?... I miss her. Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? Thanks! Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. Now, see, I do n't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!... So Chandler looks gay, huh? Y'know, I du n no who this is, but it's not Debbie. I thought it was gon na be a closed casket. Well, that does n't mean she ca n't look nice! Sweetie, you think you can get in there? I do n't see why not. Here's my retainer! I was just thinking. When my time comes - Dad! Listen to me! When my time comes, I wan na be buried at sea. You what? I wan na be buried at sea, it looks like fun. Define fun. C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...... And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun. Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says' Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say' Buried at sea! Huh!'. That's probably what they'll say. I'd like that. Hey, gorgeous. Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um - No, nono, do n't - do n't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake. Oh! Okay! Phew! So, uh... what do you think it is about me? I du n no, uh... you just have a-a...... Quality, right, great. Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple. Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with? What? Lowell's cute! Well, yeah...' s'no Brian in Payroll. Is Brian...? No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gon na set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like Brian. Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league. Excuse me? You do n't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.... I'm really not. This one? No. I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant - suit, go with the burgundy. You know, whatever we pick, Ross' grandmother would've told us it's the wrong one. You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. Wait! We need shoes! Okay. Um, how about these? That's really a day shoe. And where Ross' grandmother's going everyone else'll be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. No, it really should be burgundy. Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. Oh my God.. Is everything all right, dear? Yeah, just... just Nana stuff. How we doing, you guys ready? Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? Some days it's all I can think about. Hi, sorry I'm late, I could n't find my bearings. Oh, you - you mean your earrings? What'd I say? Hm - m. Are these the shoes? Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy. What, we - uh - we do n't have shoes here, or...? Morning. We ready to go? Well, do n't we look nice all dressed up?... It's stuff like that, is n't it? It was a really beautiful service. It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream. What? Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger. Check it out, Giants - Cowboys. You're watching a football game at a funeral? No, it's the pre-game. I'm gon na watch it at the reception. You are a frightening, frightening man. Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! Oh, I hope they're not ruined. God, what a great day.... What? Weather - wise! I know, uh, the air, the - the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh - I du n no, almost life - aff - God! Ross! I'm fine. Just - just... having my worst fear realised... Okay, do n't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm... huh. What, what is it? You missed a belt loop. Oh! No - n - Okay, it's in spasm. Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. Oh, no - Sorry - Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter. Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. Hey, look who's up! How do you feel? I feel great. I feel - great, I fleel great. Wow, those pills really worked, huh? Not the first two, but the second two - woooo!... I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister, I love Pheebs... Ooh! That's so nice...... Chandler! Hey. And listen, man, if you wan na be gay, be gay. Does n't matter to me. You were right. Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most. Oh, well you know who I love the most? No. You! Oh.. you do n't get it! Whaddya got there? Just a, uh... hearing disability. What's the score? Seventeen - fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third. Beautiful! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Your grandmother would have hated this. Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. No, I'd be hearing about' Why did n't I get the honey - glazed ham?', I did n't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more Monica's grandmother'd be saying' Why are you wasting your money? I do n't need flowers, I'm dead'. That sounds like Nana. Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?... I can imagine. I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life - affirming person that Mrs. Geller is. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her? Tell her what? How Monica's grandmother drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told Monica's grandmother the truth?... No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. Huh. More wine, dear? Oh, I think so. Those earrings look really lovely on you. Thank you. They're yours. Actually they were Nana's. Now I'm depressed!... Even more than I was. Hey, who's this little naked guy? That little naked guy would be me. Aww, look at the little thing. Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown - ups now? Who are those people? Got me. Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.' Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? Looks like a fun gang. Ooh, look - look - look - look - look! I got Monica naked! Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. Hey, Lowell. Hey, Chandler. So how's it going there in Financial Services? It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How' bout you? Good, good. Listen, heh, I du n no what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not. I know. That's what I told her. Really. Yeah. So - you can tell? Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar. So you do n't think I have a, a quality? Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. He is? Yup, and waaay out of your league. Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian. Hey, Brian. \n","Terry, I, I, I know that I have n't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $ 100 advance in my salary? An advance? It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job. Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that. Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips? Huh? Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $ 98.50 to go. Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? No, they're not. Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. You're wrong. I am not wrong. You're wrong. No, I just talked to them. I'm calling Mom. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. And this from the cry - for - help department. Are you wearing makeup? Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model. That's so funny,'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman. What were you modeling for? You know those posters for the city free clinic? Oh, wow, so you're gon na be one of those \" healthy, healthy, healthy guys \"? You know, the asthma guy was really cute. Do you know which one you're gon na be? No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... Good luck, man. I hope you get it. Thanks. Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right? Yeah. And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. Yes, every single one of them. Phoebe, you're gon na be with your grandma? Yes, and Phoebe's grandmother boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December'cause Phoebe's grandmother's boyfriend is lunar. So you're free Thursday, then. Yeah. Oh, can I come? Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gon na make it to Vail? Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go. I thought it was $ 98.50. Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. Well, I'm off to Carol's. Ooh, ooh! Why do n't we invite Carol Willick? Ooh, ooh. Because Carol Willick's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring Carol Willick, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. Hi, is uh, is Carol here? No, Carol Willick's at a faculty meeting. Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan : Come in. Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. What's it look like? Kinda like a big face without skin. Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they do n't let you do it. Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. The uh, the baby that has n't been born yet? Would n't that mean you're... crazy? What, you do n't think they can hear sounds in there? You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Do you uh, do you talk about me? Yeah, yeah, all the time. Really? But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this. Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head. Hey, Rach, did you make your money? No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop. Rach, here's your mail. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. No, here's your mail. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. Would you just open it? Oh my god, oh, you guys are great. We all chipped in. We did? You owe me 20 bucks. Thank you. Thank you so much! Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? All right, I'm nine years old. Oh, I hate this story. We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have -- and I remember this part vividly -- a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. Oh my god. Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together. We did? Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis? Yeah, right. I got ta tell you. You're the best in the business. Get out. I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back. Really? You do n't know what that means to me. Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing? Nothing. Listen, uh, you wan na go get a drink or something? Yeah. Oh. What's wrong? I just remembered, I have to do something. Oh. What? Um, leave. Wait, wait, wait! So I guess you all saw it. Saw what? No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious. Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. Tonight, on a very special Blossom. Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What? I do n't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. That's closer. I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. Oh, you must stop shooping. Ok, I'm gon na get my stuff. Chandler, will you just come in already? No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. Look out, incoming pumpkin pie! Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. Hey, Monica, I got a question. I do n't see any tater tots. That's not a question. But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I ca n't be with my family because of my disease. All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. Ah! Ok, Mom never hit. Ok, all done. What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps! Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. Why would we do that? Well,'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. Ok, good - bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. The balloon? No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, Underdog broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? I ca n't, I got ta go. Come on. An 80 - foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen? Almost never. Got the keys? or Got the keys! Ok. Anytime you're ready. Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... Just aim for the bump. Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, ca n't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid. So do n't do it, it's fine. You do n't have to do it just because Susan does it. Hello, baby. Hello, hello. I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park. Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean. Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here? We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys. No I do n't. Yes, you do. When we left, you said, \" got the keys. \" No I did n't. I asked, \" got the ke - eys? \" No, no, no, you said, \" got the keys \". Do either of you have the keys? The oven is on. Oh, I got ta get my ticket! Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. Well then get it, get it! That tone will not make me go any faster. Joey! That one will. And everyone's telling me, you got ta pick a major, you got ta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you do n't have gills anymore. Look, you do n't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want. Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok? Hi, how's it goin? Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that? I did. Does it always, uh --? No, no that was the first. Keep singing! Keep singing! Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I ca n't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. I felt it! Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts. Nope, not that one. Can you go any faster with that? Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math. Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? For an emergency just like this. All right, listen, smirky. If it was n't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not. I swear you said you had the keys. No, I did n't. I would n't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously did n't have the keys. Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys. Why would I have the keys? Aside from the fact that you said you had them? But I did n't. Well, you should have. Why? Because! Why? Because! Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Is n't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I... Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go. Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. Here we come, walkin' down thethis does n't smell like Mom's. No, it does n't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one. Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys. Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice. Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner? You call that delicious? Stop it, stop it, stop it! Now this feels like Thanksgiving. Ooh. What? Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal. I've got ta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy! Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing! It's nice that he has someone. Shall I carve? By all means. Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? I do n't even wan na know about the dark cheese. Does anybody wan na split this with me? Oh, I will. Ooh, you guys have to make a wish. Make a wish? Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for? The bigger half. I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this is n't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it did n't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you did n't have syphilis and stuff, we would n't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. That's so sweet. And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. And a crappy New Year. Here, here! Bladder Control Problem Stop Wife Beating Hemorrhoids? Winner of 3 Tony Awards... He's finally happy with that and walks away. \n","Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. Oooh! W - wait. What is that?' That' would be Marcel. You wan na say hi? No, no, I do n't. Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass! Ross, is he gon na live with you, like, in your apartment? Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so... Why do n't you just get a roommate? Nah, I du n no... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe -.... sorry, that's, that's' pathet', which is Sanskrit for' really cool way to live'. So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. Might wan na open with the snowman. Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy. So, how'd it go? Ahhhhhh, I did n't get the job. How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. I du n no. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. So what are you gon na be? Ah, I'm gon na be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know? Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You do n't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday : desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud! Well, for your information, Paolo is gon na be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. Yeah, you wish! It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us - dinner. Yeah, okay. Alright. Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. Woooo! Yeah! Phoebe, you're on. Oh, oh, good. Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh! Thanks, hi. Um, I wan na start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...... My mother's ashes Even Lily Buffay eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...... I feel a little sneezy And now I - Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group? No. No, that's - that's okay. Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! That guy's going home with a note! Noth - I was - I was just saying to my - Could you speak up please? Sorry, I wa - I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my - in my life. And then Max said that - you said you thought Daryl Hannah. Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked Daryl Hannah in Splash, a lot, but not so much in - in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a Hard quality. - hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that - that - that's when you started yelling. Okay, we're gon na take a short break. Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! Come here, Marcel. Sit here. Pheebs, I ca n't believe David Hasselhof has n't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean Paolo had already named both my breasts!... Ooh. Did I just share too much? Just a smidge. David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. David Hasselhof's very methodical. I think it's romantic. Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? Yeah! Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he - David Hasselhof's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just - I just wan na be with David Hasselhof all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gon na ask him to New Year's, are n't you. You're gon na break the pact. Phoebe Buffay's gon na break the pact. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just? Yeah,'cause I already asked Janice. What?! C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! I snapped, okay? I could n't handle the pressure and I snapped. Yeah, but Janice? That - that was like the worst breakup in history! I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. Too many jokes... must mock Joey! Nice shoes, huh? Aah, y'killing me! Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! Okay, look, he's not gon na hurt them, right? Do you always have to bring him here? I did n't wan na leave him alone. Alright? We - we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I did n't mean, and he - he threw some faeces... Y'know, if you're gon na work late, I could look in on him for you. Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.... But, you ca n't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. Okay, alright, I have a question, then. Yuh. Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well,'cause it's you. Sure. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just got ta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper!... trapped inside a physicist's body. Rrrreally. Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.... Now? Now? Oh yeah, right now. Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take - this was a gift. Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you - you wan na just hop? I can hop. So tell me something. What does the phrase' no date pact' mean to you? I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody - I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby? Yeah. You know more than one Fun Bobby? I happen to know a Fun Bob. Okay, here we go... Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! There. Now there is. Okay, so on our no - date evening, three of you now have dates. Uh, four. Four. Five. Five. Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? Okay, so I'm gon na be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no - one'll know who's with who. Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now. What's the matter? Oh, it's - it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. Really. Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. What, uh... what juggling thing? With the balled - up socks? I figured you taught him that. No. Y'know, it was n't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon... Phoebe. Hi. Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? No. Have you seen David? No, no, he has n't been around. Well, if you see David Hasselhof, tell David Hasselhof to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk. Minsk? Minsk. It's in Russia. I know where Minsk is. We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. So when, when do you leave? January first. Hello? Hey! Hi. Hi! What - what're you doing here? Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting! It'd be even more exciting if we were going. Oh, you're not going? Oh, why? Tell her, David.' I do n't wan na go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wan na stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' Thank you, Max. Thank you. So - so you're really not going? I do n't know. I do n't know what I'm gon na do. I just - you decide. Oh do n't do that. Please. Oh no no. No, but I'm asking - Oh, but I ca n't do that - No, but I ca n't - It's your thing, and - - make the decision - Okay, um, stay. Stay. Stay. Getting so good at that! It was Max's stuff. I love this artichoke thing! Oh, do n't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! You remember Janice. Vividly. Hi. Hi, I'm Sandy. Sandy! Hi! C'mon in!... You brought your kids. Yeah. That's okay, right? Par - tay! That thing is not coming in here.' That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she would n't be welcome in your home? I'm guessing your new girlfriend would n't urinate on my coffee table. Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... Alright. Just keep him away from me. Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where - where's Paolo? Rome. Jerk missed his flight. And then... your face is bloated? No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman - this blonde planet with a pocketbook - starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts - starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle... oh... everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip? Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. Wow, that's, uh, dirty. Yeah. Hey, kids... Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! But you found me! Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera! Kill me. Kill me now. Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby! Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he - died about two hours ago. But I-I-I could n't get a flight out' til tomorrow, so here I am! Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? It's gon na be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll - I get to see him again. Oh, I'm gon na blow this one up, and I'm gon na write' Reunited' in glitter. Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I did n't necessarily think that it meant that we - Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm sorry you misunderstood... Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gon na be your last chance with me. Oh, will you give me the thing. Hi, Max! Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you. Wow. It wo n't be the same - but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. You're going to Minsk. No, I'm... not going to Minsk. Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You ca n't stay here just'cause of me. Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I ca n't break up with you. Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um,' Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say' your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um,' it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Ca n't you understand that?'. And I say' no! No! I ca n't understand that!'. Uh, ow. Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me. I'll never forget you. And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you do n't wan na start the new year with me if you ca n't finish it. I'm gon na miss you. You scientist guy. Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square... There y'go, kids. And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight.

Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. What? The bll is drrbing! In twenty seconds it'll be midnight... And the moment of joy is upon us. Looks like that no date pact thing worked out. Everybody looks so happy. I hate that. Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby! Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. I du n no. I do n't feel like kissing anyone tonight. I ca n't kiss anyone. So I'm kissing everyone? Nonono, you ca n't kiss Ross, that's your brother. Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me! Alrightalrightalright. There. I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much does n't love you back.... I think that bitch cracked my tooth. \n","Do you think they have yesterday's daily news? Why? Just wan na check my horoscope, see if it was right. Oh my God. Phoebe. Do n't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression. Where? Ooh, come to Momma. He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. Nice hat. Thanks. We should do something. Whistle. We are not going to whistle. Come on, do it. No! Do it! No! Do it do it do it! Woo - woo! I ca n't believe you did that! Why did I' woo - hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That - that Guy'd turn round and say' I love that sound, I must have you now'? I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP! Phoebe, what are you doing? Maybe nobody's tried this. I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, Guy looks smart. I bet Guy's a lawyer. Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic. Okay, Coma Guy's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And - he can dance! Oh! And, Coma Guy's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, Coma Guy's listening, y'know, and not saying' Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked. I wish all guys could be like him. I know. Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? He does n't have anyone. Yeah, we - we feel kinda responsible. I ca n't believe you said woowoo. I do n't even say woowoo. Oh, Mrs. Bing's coming up! Mrs. Bing's coming up! Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book,' Euphoria Unbound' : the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wan na put the kids to bed for this one. Y'know, we do n't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax. No way, forget it. C'mon, Mrs. Bing's your mom! Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No? Chandler, I got ta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I can not get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool! Yeah, well, you would n't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of' Mistress Bitch.' C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think Mrs. Bing's a blast. You can say that because Mrs. Bing's not your mom. Oh, please... Bona sera. Oh, hi sweetie. When did Rigatoni get back from Rome? Last night. Ah, so then his plane did n't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had - but, phew. Hey hey hey! She's on! Ah! Nora Bing!... Now what is this about you - you being arrested i - in London? What is that all about? Your mom was arrested? Shhh, busy beaming with pride.... This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man... Now why would she say that's embarrassing? Shhh.... I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken. THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!! Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going? Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate - but I get to see my son, who I love... Awww! This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone. Y'know, do n't take this wrong, I - I just do n't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I do n't mean that, I do n't mean that bad... Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.... And then he burst into flames. Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty - five... and - oh, teams played sports. What about Glen? He could be a Glen. Nah... not - not special enough. Ooh! How about Agamemnon? Waaay too special. I am famished. What do I want... Please God do n't let it be Kung Pow Chicken. Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think? Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little. What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place. Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gim me a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila. I know I am. Who's doing shots? Yeah. I'm in. There y'go. Ross? Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. Hi! Sorry - sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.... But a man can change. Anyone want me to appraise anything? Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer. Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book. Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, any messages for room 226? You okay there, slugger? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. What is with you tonight? Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand - Licker, is n't it. No. It's the one Paolo's licking. She's supposed to be with you. You're good. Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why? The girl on the cover with Woman 1 nipples showing? No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I can not sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty - five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off. When? Man 1's not a hero.... You know who our hero is. The guy on the cover with his nipples showing? No, it's you! Please. No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy... Right. You are gon na be fine, believe me. Uh-oh... Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street. Hey, is Chandler here? Yeah. Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you did n't tell... Okay,'cause I'm thinking - we do n't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right? Right. No big deal. Okay. In Bizarro World!! You broke the code! What code? You do n't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot - lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom! What are you guys doing out here? Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept. Yeah, well, you do n't have your racket. No, no I do n't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one. Yeah, well you did n't call and leave your grip size. Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum. Ross, how could you let this happen? I do n't know, God, I... well, it's not like Mrs. Bing's a regular mom, y'know? She's, Mrs. Bing's sexy, Mrs. Bing's... You do n't think my mom's sexy? Well... not in the same way... I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here... Hey. Hey. What're you guys doing out here? Well, not playing raquetball! Ross Geller forgot to leave his grip size! Joey Tribbiani did n't get the goggles! Well, sounds like you two have issues. Goodbye, baby. Ciao, bela. Do they wait for me to do this? So are you gon na tell Chandler Bing? Why would I tell him? How about'cause if you do n't, his mother might. Oh... What are you guys doing here? Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!... What did I ask? Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here? I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off... on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me? No. No! No!... So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning? How would I know? I - I was n't here. Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! Oh my God. You're my friend. I - I had to tell you. I ca n't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? Yeah, um, I do n't know if you noticed, but Paolo had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when Paolo's drun.. uh... I ca n't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom. What? I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora - um, Mrs. Mom - your Bing - was just being nice, y'know, and - But nothing happened, nothing - Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in - You knew about this? Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. I spent the entire day with you, why did n't you tell me?! Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what would a happened. Thanks, man, big help. I ca n't believe this! What the hell were you thinking? I was n't - I mean, I - Y'know, of all my friends, no - one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. I know - I ca n't believe you did this. Chandler - Me neither, y'know what - I'm still mad at you for not telling me. What are you mad at me for?! Chandler - You got ta let me slam the door! Chandler, I did n't kiss Mrs. Bing, Ross Geller did! See what happens when you break the code? Joey - Ah! Huh? Hey. Hey.' A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his' love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'? Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no' j' in' engorged'. Hey Rach. Hey. Hello. Hello. Going to the hospital tonight? No, you? No, you? You just asked me. Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now? Okay. I am so hot! Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me Gloria Tribbiani's not a knockout. I can not believe we're having this conversation. C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all. Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay. Thanks. Hi, um,' kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.' Kay. You do n't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say... Okay, thank you very much, I'm gon na take a short break! Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo! What was that? Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a... Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother - Kisser? Mother - Kisser... I'll shut up. Chandler, can I just say something? I - I know you're still mad at me, I just wan na say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips. Yes, well, I expect this from Mrs. Bing. Okay? Mrs. Bing's always been a Freudian nightmare. Okay, well, if Mrs. Bing always behaves like this, why do n't you say something? Because it's complicated, it's complex - Hey, you kissed my mom! We're rehearsing a Greek play. That's very funny. We done now? No! Okay, you mean, you're not gon na talk to her, you're not gon na tell her how you feel? That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom does n't mean you know Mrs. Bing. Alright? Trust me, you ca n't talk to her. Okay,' you' ca n't, or you ca n't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah! Alright, whadyou do with him? Oh! You're awake! Look at you! How, how do you feel? Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay. You look good! I feel good!... Who are you? Oh, sorry. I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you. Well, we both have. So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys? Well, actually it's just from me. I got you the foot massager. You know who shaved you? That was me. I read to you. I sang. Hah! Well,... thanks. Oh, my pleasure. You're welcome. So. I guess I'll see you around. What, that's it? \" See you around? \" Well, what do you want me to say? Oh, I do n't know. Maybe, um, \" That was nice? \" Admit something to me? \" I'll call you? \" Alright, I'll call you. I do n't think you mean that. This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then - we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and \" See you around! \" Let's go, Phoebe. Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma. Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon? No, just knowing you're gon na be there is enough. Alright, well, be good, I love you. You kissed my best Ross!... Or something to that effect. O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid. Really stupid. Really stupid. And I do n't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now? Yeah. No. No... Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. You're kidding. No, no. He said \" When are you gon na grow up and start being a mom? \" Wow! Then she came back with \" The question is, when are you gon na grow up and realise I have a bomb? \"' Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she did n't say \" When are you gon na grow up and realise I am your mom? \" That makes more sense. So, what's going on now? I du n no, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I do n't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Whaddya see? Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside - down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run! You okay, kiddo? Yeah, okay. Alright. Nice save. Mrs. Bing. Mr. Geller. Hey. You mean that? Yeah, why not. So I told her. Yeah? How'd it go? Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. Well, howdya feel? Pretty good! I told her. Well, see? So, maybe it was n't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we do n't have to go down that road. Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not' reaching for her heaving beasts'. What's a' niffle'? You usually find them on the' heaving beasts'. Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist... Wait, did you get to the part about his' huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you do n't wan na be around when he starts writing with those! Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it! Nooo! \n","No - no - no - no, we're done. Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna. Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape. Ross, did you really read all these baby books? Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! Ooh, this is cool... it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. And, we're done with the yogurt. Sorry. Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy! Hello! How come you do n't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian? Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos Ah, poke a nose, mmm Mma, Mma, Mmaah So, did I hear Poconos? Yes, my sister's giving us Jill Green place for the weekend. Woo - hoo, first weekend away together! Yeah, that's a big step. I know... Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal! Was n't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Should n't it be... flung by now? I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with Paolo, I'm totally, totally...... nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration! I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever! Need a new table. You think? Hey hey, come on in! Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends Monica Geller love, along with this lasagna. Oh great! Is it vegetarian,'cause Susan does n't eat meat. I'm pretty sure that it is... So, I got the results of the amnio today. Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....? Totally and completely healthy! Oh, that's great, that is great! Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis? Uh, that's our friend Tanya. Of course it's your friend Tanya. Do n't you want to know about the sex? The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya, yaw... The sex of the baby, Ross. Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh - oh - oh! Do you want to know? No, no, no, no, no, I do n't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or is n't... Oh, hello Ross! Susan... So, so, did you hear? Yes, we did, everything's A-OK! Oh, that's so... It really is... do we know...? Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be... Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who does n't want to know, standing right here! Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be? Mm-hmmm Ok, what, what... ok, what did we think it was going to be? It's a... No, no, no I do n't want to know, do n't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go. Well, thanks for the books. No problem, ok, mmmwa oh, mmmwa Susan... All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? Hello? Uh, never mind, I do n't want to know. Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? That's the rule. What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! How'd you get to that? Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio You knew about that? Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. Ok, ok, How about if we split it? What do you mean, like, buy it together? Yeah You think we're ready for something like that? Why not? Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? Why, are you moving out? I'm not moving out. You'd tell me if you were moving out right Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... Aw, I know all about Kip! It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? Aw, do n't do that We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled Customer 5:30 shiatsu. Ok, thanks. Oh, here comes your 3:00. I do n't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe! Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here? Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh? Well, Racquela's right, yeah! Oh, okay, I do n't know what you just said, so let's get started. Uh, I am, uh, being naked? Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off... oh whoops! You're being naked! I ca n't believe you do n't want to know. I mean, I could n't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... And Monica knows... Wha, heh, how could you know, I do n't even know! Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, Carol Willick told me. So what's it gon na be? Waitohheyhuh, oh great now Joey Tribbiani knows, and I do n't know! I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt! Or an uncle... Hey Phoebe! Hi Pheebs! Pheebs! Fine! Phoebe, what's the matter? Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts. Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here? Oh, right, that's me! Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. Fine. Phoebe, what is it? All right, you know Paolo? I'm familiar with his work, yes... Well, Paolo made a move on me. Whoa, store will be open tomorrow! More coffee over here, please! Well, what happened? Well, Paolo came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. Ooooohh! My God. Are you sure? Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands were n't the problem anymore. Was it...? Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. Oooooo.... \" Ooo, \" what? Uma Thurman. Oh! The actress! Thanks Rach. So what are you gon na do? You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? Oh, yeah, you have to tell Rachel Green. Feminist issue. That's where I went! Rachel Green is gon na hate me. Yeah, well... Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? That's patio furniture! So what, like people are gon na come in and think, \" Uh - oh, I'm outside again? \" Of course! What about the birds? I do n't know, birds just do n't say, \" Hello, sit here, eat something. \" You pick one. All right, how about the ladybugs? Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! Not like that, I wo n't! Kip would have liked the birds! Hey! Hi Pheebs! Are you moving out? No, these are n't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's. Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec? Well, sure... just a sec, though,'cause Paolo's on his way over. Oh! Ok, um, ok, um, Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs... Ok, um, we have n't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?! Oh, I do n't make them a lot because I do n't think it's fair to the other cookies All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Which proves that I never lie. I guess you do n't. Paolo made a pass at me. So, what do you think? I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. I know! So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! Heads up Ross! Score! You suck! Are you okay? I need some milk. Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better? No... oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all \" Oh, Paolo, he's so great, Paolo makes me feel so... \" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed! I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on! Pheebs, if I had never met Paolo this never would have happened! I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about? I do n't know... right, he's the pig! Such a pig! Oh, God, he's such a pig, Oh Paolo's like a... He's like a big disgusting...... like a...... pig... pig man! Yes, good! Ok... Oh, but Paolo was my pig man... how did I not see this? Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you... Ok, Ok, Pheebs... The end. Oh, God... Should I not have told you? No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better... I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so... We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one... second! Score! Game! Come on. Ah... ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. No - no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing - there team. Come on, two on one. What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! What, now? Yes, now is when you swoop! You got ta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's got ta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo! My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! No, that's cold, that's cold, that's... How's it going? Do n't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm - waving,, Ok, that is either, \" How could you? \" or, \" Enormous breasts! \" Here he comes! Ooh! Uh, I am, uh, to say good - bye. Oh, ok bye - bye. Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles. Grazie. Paolo, I - I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... Oh, just look at her... Oh you guys, I - I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed... Oh, you're right.... and I really think it should be me. Hey. Hey. You all right? Ooh, I've been better... Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him... you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. Oh, Ross... What? I am so sick of guys. I do n't want to look at another guy, I do n't want to think about another guy, I do n't even want to be near another guy. Huh. Oh Ross, you're so great! Ohhhh Ooh... hey honey, are you all right? Oh... You ok?... medium... hmm... any cookies left? Yep! See, Rach, uh, see, I do n't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really do n't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want Uh, no, no, see, because not... not all guys are going to be a Paolo. No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. What? What? I - I'm, I'm having a boy? Uh... no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy. Wha - I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy? Yes, you're having a boy! I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy! Wha - Wha - What is it? I'm having a boy! I - I'm having a boy! Hey! Hey! We already knew that! I'm having a son. Um... Yes! And that would be a shut - down! Shut - out!! Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game! Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning! Yeah, get out! You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies! All right, ok, I got ta go. I'm going, and I'm gone. One more game? Oh yeah! \n","That is it! You just barge in here, you do n't knock I'm sorry! You have no respect for anybody's privacy! Rachel, wait, wait. No, you wait! This is ridiculous! Can I just say one thing? What? What?! That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas. Oh!! Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower. That's pretty much it. Oops! But you tell it really well, sweetie. Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you. Okay. I'll miss you. Is n't he great? He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much. I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know? So, you think you'll do it on his couch? Oh, I do n't know, I do n't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl. Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else? Oh, yes, could I have one of those. No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else? Okay. Did I, uh, did I miss something? No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies? It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts. Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please? Yeah,'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts. Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change. Y'know, I do n't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies. Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice. Okaaay, rock, hard place, me. You're so funny! He's really funny! I would n't wan na be there when when the laughter stops. Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that? Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance. Huh. I mean hey! I just met you, I do n't know you from Adam.... Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty. Uhhuh, how did you know that? It's textbook. Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right? Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib! Hey, how long are you in the city? Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I do n't know this one. Oh, this is my friend Roger. Hi. Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger. You too, sir. What happened to the, uh, puppet guy? Dad, dad. Oh,' scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny! Got ta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this is n't Ma? Ronni Rappelano name's Ronni. Ronni Rappelano's a pet mortician. Sure. So how long you been... Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? Since then?! No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I was n't always such a terrible guy.... Joe. Y'ever been in love?... I d'know. Then y'have n't. You're burning your tomatoes. You're one to talk. Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. Oh man. Please tell me one of' em is Ma. Of course, course one of' em's Ma. What's the matter with you. It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. Mr. Tribbiani's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows! I know, I mean, why ca n't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why ca n't you stop staring at my breasts? What? What? Did you not get a good enough look the other day? Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw Rachel Green boobies, I think, uh, you're gon na have to show her your peepee. Y'know, I do n't see that happening? C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat. Well I'm not showing you my' tat.' Hello? It's Phoebe. And Rog. C'mon up. Oh, good. Rog is here. What's the matter with Rog? Yeah. Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy. What, so Roger was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, Roger's not that bad. Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry Carol Willick if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian? I du n no. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why? I do n't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you... Wait - wait, go back to that sibling thing. Well, I do n't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. That that's ridiculous! I do n't feel guilty for Monica Geller failures! Oh! So you think I'm a failure! Is n't Roger good? Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying... Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better! Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good! You're right! I mean you're right! It was n't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gon na catch that movie, we got ta get going. Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel,' kay? Geez, we're gon na be late, sweetie... Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon. You're welcome. Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love. Hate that guy! Night, you guys. Oh look, it's the woman we ordered. Hey. Can, uh, can we help you? Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani. I'm Joey Tribbiani. Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I - I'm, I'm Ronni.... Cheese Nip? Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know? Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want' em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. Joey, if I go first, I wan na be looking for my keys. That's a good one! Hey, Joe. Dad, Ronni's here. Huh? Hi. Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here? Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. Thank you. Uh... So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk? Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I - I'd better get going, I do n't wan na miss the last train. I do n't want you taking that thing. Oh, where'm I gon na stay, here? Who - ah - ho. We'll go to a hotel. We'll go to a hotel. No you wo n't. No we wo n't. If you go to a hotel you'll be... doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you. You're gon na keep an eye on us? That's right, mister, and I do n't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gon na live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend. Wow. Joey Tribbiani's strict. Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room. Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid. C'mon, I'll show you to my room.... That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \" No thanks, it's late. \" Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you got ta make a change. This has gone on long enough. What kinda change? Well, either you break it off with Ronni I ca n't do that! Then you got ta come clean with Ma! This is not right! Yeah, but this is I do n't wan na hear it! Now go to my room! Hey, Kicky. What're you doing? Just trying to get comfortable. I ca n't sleep in my underwear. Well, you're gon na. I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls... Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe - fitting business, did you cave? No. No. You decided to go into the out-of - work actor business. Now that was n't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \" No thanks, I'm married. \" You really think so? Yeah. I really do. Thanks, Chandler. Get off! Hi. Hi... May I help you? Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours? Okay... who are you? Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress? Oh, c'mon in. Thanks. Hi, I'm Rachel. Hi. Bathroom's up there. Great. Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower? Oh, like, uh, five minutes? Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib. Hey. Morning, dear. Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing. What's the matter with you?! I thought it was Chandler! What? What? You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing! Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. Hey, Pheebs. Hey. How's it going? Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and Roger wanted me to invite you guys. So what's going on? Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. I du n no, there's just something about... Basically we just feel that Roger's... We hate that guy. Yeah. Hate him. We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, do n't you think, maybe, though, it's just that Roger's so perceptive that it freaks you out?... No, we hate him. We're sorry. Ma! What're you doing here? I came to give you this and this. Oww! Big ring! Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. Hold on, you - you knew? Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \" I'm sleeping over at my accountant's, \" I mean, what is that? Please! So then how could you I mean, how could you?! Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made Mr. Tribbiani happy, nothing made Mr. Tribbiani happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, Mr. Tribbiani has a hobby. Ma, I do n't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you? Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no Ronni Rappelano, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle - stuffer came along, Mr. Tribbiani's been so ashamed of himself that Mr. Tribbiani's been more attentive, Mr. Tribbiani's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary. I'm... happy... for you? Well do n't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was. Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her? Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is. That's sweet. Could I take Ronni Rappelano? With this ring? No contest. What's wrong, sweetie? Nothing, nothing. Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They - they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they do n't. Oh. They do n't. But they do n't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They do n't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little... What? Intense and creepy. Oh. But I do n't. Me, Phoebe. Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. You're not? See, that's why you're so great! Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all' Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'. So you talked to your dad, huh. Yeah. He's gon na keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gon na keep pretending she does n't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina ca n't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order... which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today. Wow. Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain. So Joey, you okay? Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you got ta let go. Even if you know better, you've got ta let them make their own mistakes. Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them. If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty - year - old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom. Hey. Hey, Pheebs. How's it going? Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger. Awww. Yeah, right. Aaawwwwww!! What happened? I do n't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy! Hey, Joey. What's going on? Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop : Rachel Green. Joey!! What the hell were you doing?! Sorry. Wrong boobies. Hello, Joey. Oh!... Hello, dear. \n","I'm tellin' you Ross, Woman wants you. Woman barely knows me. We just live in the same building. Any contact? Woman lent me an egg once. You're in! Aw, right. Hi, Ross. Hey. Come on, Ross, you got ta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI do n't think we need a third... Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks. An egg? Yeah, you're gon na go up to Woman and say, \" Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg. \" I think it's winning. I think it's insane. Woman'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend. Think it'll work? No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg. You can not do this. Do what, do what? Roger wants to take Phoebe Buffay out tomorrow night. No! Phoebes! Do n't you remember why you dumped the guy?' Cause Roger was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do. Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night? Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... No, no, no, do n't you dare bail on me. The only reason Joey's date's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. Yes, I know, but Joey's date friend sounds like such a... Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha - ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. Hi. Woman 1 said yes. Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh? How do I look? Oh, uh, I... do n't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.... And what did you bring? She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gon na go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. Janice? Oh.... my.... God. Hey, it's Janice. Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. No, no, no, do n't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months! Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I ca n't go when I'm nervous. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but Roger was nothing compared to Pete Carney. Which one was Pete Carney? Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. \" Was it good for you? \" Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard - the - \" I - win \" - guy. \" I win! I win! \" I went out with the guy for two monthsI did n't get to win once. How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people! I do n't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets. I know I am. That's why I ca n't wear a digital watch. There's more beer, right? Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves Abby head? Abby said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual. Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald. Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect. Ok, well, what kind of ritual? Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us. Or? Or... or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks. Burning's good. Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn. You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. That's OK. Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. We ca n't do that. What? What ca n't you do? Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? Uh, we might be leaving now. Tell me it's \" you and me \" we. Lorraine said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it. Ok, you can not do this to me. You're right, I'm sorry. You're right. Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please? I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler. I hope Lorraine throws up on you. So... Just us. Oh, what a crappy night! Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. Excuse me. How ya doin'? So, do we have the best friends or what? Joey's not a friend. Joey Tribbiani's... a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV? I will go for that drink. You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne? Each. That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know... Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened? No... no! And yet it did. Good - bye, Janice. Kiss me! Oh, Chandler, sorry. Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice. Hi, Monica. Ok, well, this was very special. Rach, come see who's out here! Oh my god. Janice, hi! Janice is gon na go away now. I'll be right back. Oh, Joey, look who it is. Whoa. Oh, good, Joey's home now. This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall. Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. Ross Geller just happened to call. Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he does n't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. That's funny. Who are they? The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching Carol Willick is her... close, personal friend. You mean they're lovers. If you wan na put a label on it. Wow, uh, anything else I should know? Nope, nope, that's it. Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo! Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine. All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca. Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man. Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we would n't be doing the ritual in the first place. Can we just start throwing things in? Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK. Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts. Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah. Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked. Hey he's wearing a sweater. No. Eww! And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa. Hey, Rachel, is n't that stuff almost pure... How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day? I do n't know. You dumped her on New Year's. Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush. Hello, funny Valentine. Hi, Just Janice. Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gon na! If you do n't do it, I will. So, um, what do you do for a living? Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..... which is funny because, that was n't even my major. Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. I thought they could... I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. Now that is funny. Hey, do you think... would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?' Cause Carol Willick's, Carol Willick's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. I guess. Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wan na come over and join us? Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, wo n't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...... does something that, funnily enough, was n't even Kristin major! What do we got there? A piece of something : boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half - charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief! You know, it's a really funny story how this happened. It's all right. It's all right. You do n't have to explain. This is n't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. You're our third call tonight. Really? Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. I brought you something. Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever. I had them made special. Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just do n't things are gon na work out. That's fine. It is? Mmm - hmm. Because I know that this is n't the end. Oh no, you see, actually it is. No, it is n't, because you wo n't let that happen. Do n't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing. Oh, no I do n't. Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? I did, but... You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You ca n't live without me. And you know it. You just do n't know you know it. See ya. Call me! It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom? Uh, I do n't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone. Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years. That could be it. Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot. Mushroom. Smile. They wo n't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny No, it's just... you know the whole \" getting on with your life \" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I do n't, I do n't have to... You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gon na say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You ca n't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you. Oh, I love you too. But... No but, no but. You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you. That's easy for you to say, you found one already. All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. Not her. We get off around midnight, why do n't we pick you up then? So, um, will you bring the truck? I'll even let you ring the bell. Oh, my god. See, there you go, the cleansing works! They're nice guys. Oh, they're firemen guys. You guys tell them you were married? No way! Are you kidding? My girlfriend does n't know, I'm not gon na tell them! \n","Coffee. Thank you. Cappuccino. Grazie. And a nice hot cider for Monica. Aww, thank you. Uh Rach? Yeah? Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser? Oh! That's why. I'm sorry! Chandler. Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing. Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and Chandler Bing says Chandler Bing has, like, this incredible news, so when Chandler Bing gets here, we could all act like, you know... Hey! Hey! Never mind. But it was going to be really good. What's going on? What is it? So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. That's great! So.... I quit. Why? Why? This was supposed to be a temp job! Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years. If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. So was it a lot more money? It does n't matter. I just do n't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.... the WENUS? Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term. Oh. That WENUS. So what're you going to do? I do n't know. That's the thing. I do n't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, Steve's opening up a restaurant and Steve's looking for a head chef. Um... hi there. Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... Yeah... I just do n't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all - toast restaurant. Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is Steve looking for? Well, Steve wants to do some ecclectic, so Steve's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu. Oh my God! Yeah, I know! So, what do you think? Thanks, Phoebe. But I just do n't really see myself in a big white hat. OK. Oh Monica! Guess what! Can you see my nipples through this shirt? No. But do n't worry, I'm sure they're still there. Where are you going, Mr. Suity - Man? Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the \" a - gogo. \" Career counselor? Hey, you guys all know what you want to do. I do n't! Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I do n't have a dream. Ah, the lesser - known \" I do n't have a dream \" speech. Oh, I love my life, I love my life! Ooh! Brian's Song! The meeting with the guy went great? So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for Steve Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, Steve really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can' ooh' and' ahh' and make yummy noises. What are you going to make? Yummy noises. And Monica, what are you going to make? I do n't know. I do n't know. It's just going to be so great! Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I do n't know. Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood? How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32 - ounce steak, it's free. OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? Who are you going out with? Oh, is this the bug lady? Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross. Her name is Celia. Celia's not a bug lady. Celia's curator of insects at the museum. So what are you guys going to do? Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring Celia back to my place and I'd introduce Celia to my monkey. And he's not speaking metaphorically. So.... back to your place... you thinking, maybe... huh - huh? Well, I do n't know.... huh - huh.... but I'm hoping huh - huh. I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. Celia, do n't worry! Do n't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel... I ca n't stand this! He's got his claws in my... Alright... OK, try this salmon mousse. Mmmm. Good. Is it better than the other salmon mousse? It's creamier. Yeah, well, is that better? I do n't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? My God! What happened to you? Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? \" You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation. \" That's so great!' Cause you already know how to do that! Can you believe it? I mean, do n't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something... something. Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt! Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up. Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz - bouche. Well.... it is amouz - ing... Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Ten dollars an hour for what? Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if Wendy'd help me out. Waitressing? Uh-oh. Well... of course I thought of you! But... but... But, but? But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress. Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics. You know, I do n't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76. Amouz - bouche? Talk to me. OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning... No no no. Talk... dirty. Wha... what, here? Yes... Ah.... Say something..... hot. Er.... um..... What? Um... uh.... vulva. Vulva? Alright, I panicked, alright? Celia took me by surprise. You know, but it was n't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling. Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?? Shut up! It was nice. I just... I do n't think I'm the dirty - talking kind of guy, you know? What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to Celia. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. Please be kidding. Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. OK. I'm in my apartment....... yeah... what else? That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. Alright, look, I'll start, OK? Joey, please. Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. Wow. Alright, now you say something. I... ahem... I really do n't think so. Come on! You like this woman, right? Yeah. You want to see her again, right? Sure. Well if you ca n't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to Celia? Now tell me you want to caress my butt! OK, turn around. I just do n't want you staring at me when I'm doing this. Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead. Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips. There you go! Keep going. Keep going! I, er... I want to take my tongue... and....... and.... Say it... say it!... run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with....... with?? Funny story! You're not going to believe this! It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together. Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again. Again? And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again. Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this is n't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! Well? Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. Look at this! Oh! You have a window! Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of... Oh look! That guy's peeing! OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. OK. This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment? Thank you Helen, that'll be all. Last time I do that, I promise. Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Who was that? Wendy bailed. I have no waitress. Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. Ten dollars an hour. No. Twelve dollars an hour. Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around. You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour. Done. Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat? Hi Steve! Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl. This is Rachel. Yeah, OK. Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I ca n't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells. It's a lovely apartment. Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour? I was just being polite, but, alright. What's up? In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie. What? Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja? OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK. Is it dry in here? Let me, let me get you some wine! Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot - shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...... with just a touch of mints... and...... ginger. Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic! I'm so glad you liked them! Like' em? I could eat a hundred of them! Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. Excuse me? Can I help you with anything? You know, I do n't know what I'm looking for. Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope. You know that? You do n't want to spoil your appetite. Hey! Sugar - O's! You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes... Macaroni and cheese! We got ta make this! No, we do n't. Oh, OK. Oh, sorry. Why do n't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi - bears. No. Give them to me. Alright, we'll share. No, give me the... Well then you ca n't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar - O... save yourself! \" Help! I'm drowning! Help! \" That's it! Dinner is over! What? What? Why? Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you ca n't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet? Hey! What a tool! You do n't want to work for a guy like that. Yeah! I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it. Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef. Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I was n't faking. So, er... how did it go with Celia? Oh, I was unbelievable. All right, Ross! I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers. Whoa! And the... huh - huh? Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh... You cuddled. Yeah, which was nice. You guys wan na try and catch a late movie or something? Maybe, but should n't we wait for Chandler? Yeah, where the hell is he? Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa.... How's this? Eeeee! Sorry. How about over here? Aaaaah! See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? No. What about this? Aaaaahhh!! There you go! \n","This is unbelievable. Its been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, youd be looking like a ham right about now. Theres the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss? Its Phoebe! Hi! Hi. Okay, will that be all? Wait, wait! Wh - what are you doing here? Yeah, um, I was over there, then you said, \" Excuse me, hello Miss, \" so now Im here. No, no... how come you are working here? Right, yeah, cause its close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute. Can we start over? Yeah. Okay great. Im gon na be over here. No, no, no! I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, \" supposedly \" by accident. No, yeah, Ive done that. And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword. Ive never done that. All right, now look at her and tell me she doesnt look exactly like her sister. Im sayin I see a difference. Theyre twins! I dont care. Phoebes Phoebe. Ursulas... hot!

Definitely Phoebe Buffay. Yeah. I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl Nina Bookbinder doesnt have a job yet? Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights. Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument. Im just trying to find the right moment, you know? Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. \" Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work? \" Hey. Hey. You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more. I'll get it. Oh. Hi, Mr. Heckles. Youre doing it again. Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly. I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep. You dont even have cats. I could have cats. Goodbye Mr. Heckles. Well try to keep it down. Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wan na make sure it fits. Ooh, my first birthday present..... oh, this is really... Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size - wise. Ohhh...

Yes, yes Nina Bookbinder is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let Nina Bookbinder go, err, I got a call from Nina Bookbinder psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen - nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan. And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, Dr. Flanen uh, mentioned the word frenzy. Youre kidding? She seems so... Oh, no, no. Nina..... Nina Bookbinder is whooo wewee - woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked Nina Bookbinder right now, Nina Bookbinder would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. Thats unbelievable. And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire Nina Bookbinder again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir... a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth. Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class. Susan, go deep. This is impossible. Its just impossible. What is, honey?

Wherere you going? Out. With? Yes. Alright, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet? Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay? You meant sex, right? Do you have a sec? Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up? I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us. Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors. Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise. I am? Sure, why not? Oh my god! Youre amazing! Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise? So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel? What? Helen drinks. Will you marry me? Well, I ended up telling her everything. Oh, howd she take it? Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip : if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand..... on the desk. Okay, I think I get how to do this. Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch. okay, Pheebs, theyre gone. Okay. Are you alright? Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its... Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible? Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything.

And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? No. Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wan na be around... anything that looked like either one of us. Oh... Oh, Pheebs. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but... Youre not gon na lose him. Hon, you got ta talk to Joey. Yeah. Okay. No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt. But hes falling in love with her.

Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch Ben, right?

Look, I do n't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. And your friend Phoebe? Well, if Phoebe Buffay's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, would n't you guys? Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit... you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference. Okay, errrr, Monica?

Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say \" get out of my office! \" Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash ; Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing.

Is that what this is about? No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.' Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How' bout we do that? Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father? Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you do n't wan na go to Williamsburg? No, we can go to Williamsburg. Eat your fish. Rachel, the cute doctors are here. Okay, coming! Hi, come on in. Hey. Hi, Geoffrey. Hi. Ah here, we brought wine.

After all it, is your ankle. You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why do n't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT! Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why do n't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine. It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble. Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss? A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay? So? So... they sss - still seem normal. That's because they are. okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into... Willya relax? Look around.

Alright babe, deal the cards. Dammit, dammit, dammit! : Oh I see, so then, you were lying. About what? About how good your cards were. Heh... I was bluffing. A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying? OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rach, Rach, we got ta settle. Settle what? The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game. Oh. Right. You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why do n't we just forget about the money, alright? Hell no, we'll pay! OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready. And you know what? We want a rematch. Well that's fine with me. Could use the money. : So basically, you get your ya - yas by taking money from all of your friends.... Yeah. Yes, and I get my ya - yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gon na play poker with me, do n't expect me to be a' nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...... Yeah? I'm not a nice guy. Alright boys, let's eat. Oh, did you get that from the' I Love Rachel' pizzeria? You still on that? Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : \" When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy! \" You are way off, pal. No, I do n't think so, see Ross, because I think you love Rachel Green. Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for Rachel Green at one timenot any more. I justI... Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. Ha. Ha, ha. What? Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. Please! I am not as bad as Ross. Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident? That was not an incident! I - I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand. Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! You're kidding! Where? Where? : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue. Oh, Rachel! Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home. Well, what's the job? Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living! OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since Aunt Iris was five. You got ta listen to every word she says. Hi! Is Tony Randall dead? No. I do n't think so. Why? Well, Tony Randall may be now, because I think I hit him with my car. What? Oh my God! Really? No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings. Thank y... Girls, sit down. Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it. Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? Alright. I'm gon na pay for that tonight. Hi! Hey. Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? Noooo... the interview! She loved me! Rachel's interviewer absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! That's great! That's wonderful! Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story... OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker. Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you do n't want to play, we completely understand. Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I do n't know... Pictionary? Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies? Yes, we should. I think we should. Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those? No, no, that s OK. Y'know, I think I'm gon na give it a go. Alright. Alright... So, Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, you owe $ 10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we got ta play that at our regular game. Alright, here's my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed. What? Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break' em up with a movie. Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... Mmm - hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever. Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon. So, you gals wan na hand over your money now? That way, we do n't have to go through the formality of actually playing. Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy. OK, we done with the chit - chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker? Hey you guys, look, the one - eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker. Excuse me, where are you going? Uh... to the bathroom. Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wan na play poker? I want to go to the bathroom.

Call. I'm in. I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit. Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that? : Loser? No, I fold. What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that' once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it? I'm in. How many you want? One. Dealer takes two. What do you bet? I bet two dollars. OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty.

Y'know, that's a tough hand to beat. : I thought we had them! Oh, well, when you do n't have the cards, you do n't have the cards, you know. But, uh... look how happy she is. Airplane! Airport! Airport'75! Airport'77! Airport'79! Oh, time's up. Bye... bye... BIRDIE. Oh! That's a bird? That's a bird! OK, OK, it's my turn. Go. Uh.... bean! Bean! The Unbearable Likeness of Being! Yes! That, you get? That, you get? \n","Okay, okay, I checked. We have : Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you? Okay. Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven. Thank you. Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee! Oh good!' Cause where else would we get any?

Bring me the' and - Rach? What? Hi. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them. Really. No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were - with somebody. Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh,' Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo? Oh, I do n't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual... Wait - wait. I, I got it. I was there. Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl? Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you would n't think could - could curl your toes, might just be the one who... Hi.... Gets interrupted. Hi! Hi, how was the movie? Wonderful! So good! Suck - fest. Toootal chick - flick. I - I'm sorry it was n't one of those movies with, like, y'know, guns and bombs and, like, buses going really fast... Hey, I do n't need violence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity. There was nudity! I meant female nudity. Alright? I do n't need to see Lou Grant frolicking. Hugh! Hugh Grant! Alright, I've got ta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gon na go take a bath. Yes we are, are n't we? Yes, we are. They're still just friends, right? And I will see you tomorrow! That's right, you're gon na spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, are n't you. Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?' Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gon na be there. I ca n't believe we are even having this discussion. I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief. I mean, do n't you think if things were gon na happen with Rachel, they would've happened already? I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me. She really said that? Well, I added the' exactly like me' part... But Rachel Green said Rachel Green's looking for someone, and someone is gon na be there tonight.' Tonight' tonight? Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gon na be the two of us, Rachel Green spent all day taking care of my monkey... I ca n't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo Rachel Green. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used. Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay - Wh - wh - Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl - whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe? Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh! Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you did n't register for that. Who died? Who died? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it was n't Dexter, right Marcel? Because - Marcel? Marc - How could you lose him? I do n't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe - Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one? I do n't know. The left one. Which ones? Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything. Hey. Hi. Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative? Rachel lost Marcel. Oh no, how? He - he pooped in my shoe. Which one? Those cute little black ones I wear all the time. No, which one? The right or left?' Cause the left one is lucky... C'mon, you guys, what're we gon na do, what're we gon na do? Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go? Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gon na wan na do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room. Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gon na be home any minute! He's gon na kill me! Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth. Well, what'm I gon na do? What'm I gon na do? Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you. Anybody wan na trade? Oh... Whaddyou want? Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it? I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it? No! Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? I was n't ready for it. A monkey. Have you seen a monkey? Saw Regis Philbin once... Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. You owe me a waffle. Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...... with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks. Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today? Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine? Yeah. You, uh, you want some? Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wan na go to Newark? Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North - East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well - Oh God, Ross, I can not do this. Okay, quick and painful. Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please do n't hate me. Oh, what? What - what? Y'know Marcel?... Yeah? Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him. I - I - I ca - I ca n't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment. I know, I know, I'm sorry - No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil. Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I - Oh! Who is it? Animal Control. See? I've even called Animal Control! You called Animal Control? Uh-huh... why... do you not like them? Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me. O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that... That's right, I..'cause I did n't expect you were gon na invite them to the apartment! Hi, thanks for coming. Somebody called about a monkey? Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we - we did n't. Turned out it was a hat. Cat! Cat! What'm I saying? Cat! Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no - one's seen Marcel. Marcel? My uncle Marcel. Oh, is that who the monkey's named after? Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal? Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail? Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? Yes, but there is n't always time! Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we have n't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller. Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green! Yeah! Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room! Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa! The Luisa from home room! Yes!! You have no idea who I am, do you. No, none at all. None. Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say' Morning, Luisa'? Or' Nice overalls'? Oh, I'm - I'm so sorry! Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch! What?! Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats? I could... but I wo n't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. Dun - dun - duuuur! Sorry. Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Hi, can I help you? Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we - we were looking for something... A monkey. Yes have you seen any? No. No, have n't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way? Of course. Oh. Then, no. Did I put too much rum in here? Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey. Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu. Uh, are n't we kind of in the middle of something here? Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot. We ca n't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out. Okay, from now on, you do n't get to talk to other people. Marcel? Marcel?! Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Oh - my - God! Whaaat! Something just brushed up against my right leg! What is it? Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg. Look, Phoebe! Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere! Step aside, ladies! What're you gon na do? Just a small tranquiliser. Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay? Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah. Oh gosh. Marcel? Marcel? Marc - oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's - he's just gone. Ross, you do n't know that. Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he does n't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much. Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gon na break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?! Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I do n't miss Marcel any more! Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose. Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel - land, doing your Rachel - thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings... Ross. I do n't even wan na hear it, you're just... Ross. Oh, forget it, okay? Ross! What? What? Hey! Hey, Bananaman! Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. Hi, did you order some bananas? What about it? Gim me back my monkey. I do n't have a monkey. Then what's with all the bananas? Potassium. Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel! What've you done to him? That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey. Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. C'mere, Patti. C'mere, Marcel. C'mere, Patti. Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha. Okay, gim me my monkey back. That's my monkey. You're both gon na have to take this up with the judge. That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever. Alright, I want my monkey. No! Oh, c'mon, Luisa! Sorry, prom queen. You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat. Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it! Nope. Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell Luisa's supervisor that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart? It'll be nice to get this off finally, wo n't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine. Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit. Listen, I'm - I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I... Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your... Yeah, but you were the one who got Mr. Heckles back, y'know? You, you were great.... Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape? That'd be good. Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um... Rachel. Barry?! I ca n't. I ca n't do it, I ca n't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you. Oh! We have got to start locking that door! This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids? Nope. That's because I'm in front of them. Eh. I thought that was an alp. Well, high school was not my favourite time. I du n no, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex. Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice. Gosh, does n't it seem like a million years ago? Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh! \n","I ca n't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty. No way! Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right, Mr. Salty's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. I do n't know, you do n't wan na mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy. Oh my God. You guys! You got ta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope! I ca n't believe it! Man 1's looking right at us! Oh, that is so sick. I feel violated. And not in a good way. How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we did n't have to play any games... So have you called her yet? Let her know I like Danielle? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle. I ca n't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people. Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney! Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine. Danielle answer machine? No, interestingly enough Danielle leaf blower picked up. So, uh, why did n't you say anything? Oh, no - no - no - no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \" Yes indeedy - o. \" Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, do n't everybody look at once! Okay, okay, what's going on? Okay, they're just talking... Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does Barry look like he was just told to shove anything? No, no actually, Barry's smiling.. and... Oh my God, do n't do that!! What? What? What?! That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh! And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. Oh!... Right! Hey Rach! How'd it go? Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. Barry took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out... Not a good day for birds... Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but Barry got me a little bottle of Chanel... That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm? Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see Barry again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice! That's, that's nice twice! Rachel, what's going on? I mean is n't this the same Barry who you left at the altar? Duh, where've you been? Yeah, but it was different with Barry today! And he was n't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that? Yes! Why? I have my reasons. Okay, how about the fact that Barry's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend? All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see Barry this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it! Wow... Wow! Yeah. I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. Nooo, it was n't. Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... Oh, Danielle! I was n't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye - bye. Oh God! That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?! Hey, I've been honing! What was with the dishes? Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I have n't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. Look look! Man 1's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here! Great, now Man 1's waving back. Man, we got ta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I ca n't do stuff! What kinda stuff? Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked. You cook naked? Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. What are you looking at me for? I did n't know that. What's the matter? Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good. No, it was. It was very very good. Well, what about Mindy? Oh, way, way better than Mindy. No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy? Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her. No. No - no - no - no, no. I mean, do n't do that. Not, I mean not for me. Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment. Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend. Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.. We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it. I had a bra. Hey, Dr. Farber. All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here. What?! I'm twelve, I'm not stupid. Can I use your phone? Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone. Yes, it's working! Why is n't she calling me back? Maybe Danielle never got your message. Y'know, if you want, you can call Danielle machine, and if Danielle has a lot of beeps, that means Danielle probably did n't get Danielle messages yet. Y'do n't think that makes me seem a little...... desperate, needy, pathetic? Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad. How many beeps? She answered. Y'see, this is where you'd use that' hello' word we talked about. I'm not gon na talk to her, Danielle obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. Hey! Hi! How'd Barry take it? Pretty well, actually... Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair? Oh, do I? Uh huh. We ended up having sex in his chair. You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, did n't I? You - you had what? Sex in his chair. What, uh... what were you thinking? I do n't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there.' S'like you and Carol. No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol! Please. If she said to you, \" Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now, \" what would you say? If it helps, I could slide over. It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi - I got ta go. Where are you going? I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late - for keeping up with it. Okay? Hello? Hello? Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. So how's Mindy? Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow... Oh, Mindy sounded really weird, I got ta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be! Brrrrrrr! Hell is filled with people like you. He's back! The peeper's back! Get down! Get down?... And boogie! Thanks, but I got ta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy. Relax. Y'know, Mindy may not even know. Please. I have n't heard from her in seven months, and now Mindy calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... Mindy taught me how to kiss.. Yeah? And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.... Naughty! Right, I'll see you guys later... Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or - That's fine, yeah... Okay, I'm gon na go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone? Why do n't you just take it with you? Hey, we have n't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee? Why do n't you just call her? I ca n't call Danielle, I left a message! I have some pride. Do you? No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I do n't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, Danielle's gon na call me back. She's on the other line, Danielle's gon na call me back, Danielle's on the other line, gon na call me back... Do n't you have to pee?' S'why I'm dancing... Mindy. Hey, you. Hey, you.... So, what's up? Um.. we should really be sitting for this. Sure we should... So. Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I do n't talk to anywhere,'cause she's all bitter now that Laurie Schaffer lost the weight and it turns out she does n't have a pretty face..... Okay, I'm just gon na ask you this once, and I want a straight answer. Okay. Will you be my maid of honour? Of course! Oh that's so great! Was that all you wanted to ask me? That's all! Ohhhh!!... What? What? That's not all. Oh sure it is! Oh no, it is n't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city. Um, what - what would make you think that? Well, ever since we announced the engagement, Barry's been acting really weird, and then last night, Barry came home smelling like Chanel. Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to Barry he went through a whole weird thing too. Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of! What? What's what you were afraid of? Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, Barry and I... kind of... had a little thing on the side. What? I know. I know, and when Barry proposed to me, everyone said \" Do n't do it, Barry's just gon na do to you what Barry did to Rachel, \" and now I feel so stupid. Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid. What do you mean? Smell familiar? Oh no. Oh, I am so sorry. No me, I am so sorry... Oh my. Four letters : \" Circle or hoop \". Ring dammit, ring! Thanks. Hey, you know our phone's not working? What?! I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off! Just like you told her you did!... Just pointing out the irony. Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman - I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? Nngghhh!!!!!!! Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please. \" Heating device. \" Radiator. Five letters. Rdtor. Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman. So she's a woman! So what? Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I do n't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wan na walk around my apartment in my underwear, I should n't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally.. Joey!! Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress. The green dress? Really? Yeah, Sidney Marks said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day. Nooo! Hey. Got a second? Sure, sure. Come on...... in... Hello, sweetheart. Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here? Uh, we are here to break up with you. Both of you? Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I could n't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much! Uh - which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?.... Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy. Even when we were having sex in that chair? I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you. Please! During that second time you could n't have picked her out of a lineup! You did it twice? Well, the first time did n't really count... I mean, y'know,' s'Barry. Okay... Sweetheart, just gim me - gim me another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba. Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here... Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer. Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please do n't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back. Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great. Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gon na marry him. What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock! Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wan na be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S. Oh God. I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...? And I hope Barry does n't kill you and eat you in Aruba. You okay? Yeah. Really? Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know. Aww... Big day. All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat... You know he's gay? I just wan na clarify this : are you outing Mr. Peanut? Chandler? Danielle! Hi! Uh - everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.... I'm, I'm okay. Listen uh, maybe we could get together later? That sounds good. I'll call you - or you call me, whatever... You got it. Okay. G'bye, everybody. Bye. Whoo - hoo! Yeah, there you go! Second date!... I du n no. You do n't know?! Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that? \n","How could someone get a hold of your credit card number? I have no idea. But look how much they spent! Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. I know. It's just such reckless spending. I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. Wow, what a geek. They spent $ 69.95 on a Wonder Mop. That's me. Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back - come here, Marcel - Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him. Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. What? It's, it's just a phase. Well, that's what we said about Joey... Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey! What? Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious. Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing. This woman's living my life. What? Woman 1's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. Woman 1 buys tickets for plays that I wan na see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. Woman 1 spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. You're not an artist. Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I do n't. Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things. Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we. Oh, it's so late for' Shall we'... Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School? Nooo... This is so unfair! Woman 1's got everything I want, and she does n't have my mother. How about Joey... Pepponi? No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. Joey... Switzerland? Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I du n no, this big. Which I'm not. Joe... Joe... Joe... Stalin? Stalin... Stalin... do I know that name? It sounds familiar. Well, it does not ring a bell with me... Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. Might wan na try Joseph. Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were. What are you doing? Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card? This woman's got my life, I should get to see who Fake Monica is. Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!... Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing. This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, do n't do it!!... Thank you. What d'you think? Lotsa things. Which one do you think Woman 1 is? May I help you? Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. You do n't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there. What does she mean? I think Teacher means' You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! She could be you. Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight... Okay, I'm not getting this! I'm totally getting it! Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? What? You just click when they click. Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. Great. It's gym class all over again. Aww. Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me. Why do n't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl? She's your partner. Hi. I'm Monica. Oh. Monica!... Hi. I'm Mo -... nana. Monana? Yeah. It's Dutch. You're kidding! I - I spent three years in Amsterdam. Um, Pennsylvania Dutch. And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight... Hi. Hey. Where've you been? At the vet. Woman's not gon na make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is Woman? Woman says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. Hey! He beat ya. Woman 1 says as time goes on, he's gon na start getting agressive and violent. So what does this mean? I'm gon na have to give him up. I ca n't believe it, Ross. This sucks! I do n't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I ca n't get off my leg. Is n't there any way you can keep him? No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gon na get vicious. I've just got ta get him into a zoo. How do you get a monkey into a zoo? I know that one!... No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo. Hey. We found Woman, we found the girl. What? Did you call the cops? Nope. We took her to lunch. Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. Woman stole. Woman's a stealer. Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, Woman is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.... Take off their hats! Popes in a Volkswagen!... I love that joke. No way. No way did you do this. Monana was very brave. It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...... They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I do n't know. Do n't wait up. Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.' Scuse me? There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say? Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I - I ca n't even stand in front of a tap class. Well, that's just probably'cause of your Amish background. What? Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. I - I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society? Uh-huh. I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he ca n't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought,' Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. Oh God. We did n't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I do n't know who this is harder on, me or him. I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him? Oh, somebody will. You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? You're kidding. Apparently Joseph Stalin was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! Y'know, you'd think I would've. Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?... Flame Boy. Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? Yes. Does he, uh, fight with other animals? No - no, he's, he's very docile. Even if he were... cornered? Well I, I do n't know. Why? Uh, how is he at handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what cha mean... How about a hammer, or a small blade? Why - why - why would he need a blade? Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. He - he - he got in, he - he got in to San Diego. We, we come back from our walk and the - the phone was ringing...... He's in. He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. Yo - hooo! Where the hell've you been? Monica and I just crashed an embassy party. Are you drunk?! Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk. Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... Monica? Monica! Water rules! Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wan na know if you're gon na be showing up for work? Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today. Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gon na lose your job! This is not you! No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm - I'm Monana! Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. What? They've arrested Monica. Hi. Hey. How are you? I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How - how did you know I was here? Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. That I was not expecting. I want you to know, it was n't me who turned you in. Oh. Thanks. No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it was n't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater! Well, actually, you only got to sing' Memo -'. I just ca n't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gon na do without you? Who's gon na crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gon na take me to the Big Apple Circus? Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty - five other women, and you're worried about who's gon na take you to the Big Apple Circus? Well, not... worried, just... wondering. There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gon na go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are. Not necessarily... Yes necessarily! I mean, I du n no what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing. Um, I'm not actually Amish. Really? Then why are you like that? You by the door. In or out? In. You in the back, you're getting it all wrong! Yeah, but at least I'm doing it! This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A. Okay. Good - bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but do n't eat it' till you get on the plane. Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. Oh! Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gon na be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn. I du n no what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. Just, just say what you feel. Marcel, I'm hungry. That was good. Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane. Uh, if you guys do n't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gon na miss you, and I'm never gon na forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be - Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would - okay, just take him away. Just take him. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek... That's fine, thank you. Next. Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio. Name? Holden McGroin. \n","Tell him. No. Tell Chandler Bing, tell Chandler Bing. Just... please tell him. Shut up! Tell me what? Look at you, you wo n't even look at Chandler Bing. Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women wo n't look at me. All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were... Doing it on this table. Wow! Exellent dream score. Why, why, why would you dream that? More importantly, was I any good? Well, you were pretty damn good. Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. I love it, when we share. You're okay there? I ca n't belive you two had sex in Rachel Green dream. I'm sorry, it was a one - time - thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious. Hello Rachel. Get off. Uh, uh, gim me. Can you see me operating a drill press? I do n't know. What are you wearing? Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press? Just for some short - term - work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients. Pirates again? No, nothing like that. I was just... such a dummie. I taught this \" massage - yourself - at - home - workshop. \" And they are. Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. Thanks Joey, that's a good idea. What... I could, I could do it. What is it? Well, my secretary is gon na be out for a couple of weeks. Chandler's secretary is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story. I could be a secretary. Well, you know Phoebs. I do n't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day. I could do that. What are you playing with? Oh, it's my new beeper. What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? Is it like for dinosaur emergencies.' Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all Carol Willick has to do is to dial 55 - JIMBO. A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid. All right, I'll see you guys later.

A man is being held up, at gunpoint.'' Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking : why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go. Okay. Okay. Unless... What? Uh, ah. Unless you wan na stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so... Yeah, I'd really like that. Uuh, before we get into any staying - over - stuff, there is something you should know. Okay, is this like' I have an early class tomorrow' or' I'm secretly married to a goat?' Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I have n't ever uh... Ethan? Yeah? Are you a virgin? Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person. Really? Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right? Wow! You keep saying that. You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I - I figured if you could be honest, then I can to. Oh god, do n't tell me, I did it wrong. No - no. Nothing wrong about that. Oh. Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. Huh! But I figured, you know, that should n't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said. You're not a senior? Oh, I'm a senior... in High School. Ok... ay. What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that was n't alive during the Bicentennial. I just had sex. Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? Well, you never told me how old you were. Well, that's different. My lie did n't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? I was n't thinking. I was too busy fallin'... Do n't say it.... in love with you. Really? Sorry. Well, fall out of it. You know, you should n't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins. Who? Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way. Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream. No, forget it. Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy? All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too. All right.

Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? Mon! What? Ethan called again. Oh. Are you not seeing him anymore? No. You know, sometimes just things does n't work out. And this has nothing to do with the fact that Young Ethan needs a note to get out of gym. I, I did n't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. Young Ethan stopped by. Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask Young Ethan which one the strongest Power Ranger is? Oh, yeah. Ha, ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? Sorry.

This is so your fault. How, how is this my fault? Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along. Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady? You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me. Oh, I'm threatened by you? Yes. Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I do n't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! Yeah, Susan. Do n't make me do this again, I do n't like my voice like this. Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? Help! I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow. Are they here yet? No, honey, they're not, but do n't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok? Ok. Ok? Ok. Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating. It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear. Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push' em out, push' em out, harder, harder. Push' em out, push' em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push! What're you gon na do, suck the door open? Help! Help! They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la. Help! Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. Ross Geller's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you do n't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. Where have you been? Oh, just had a baby. Mazel tov! I do n't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone? No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you? No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me. Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors. No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do. Oh. I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh... Well, for instance, what do you do? I'm a waitress. Ok, all right, well are n't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like,' if I see one more cup of coffee'... Yeah. Gotcha. I'm gon na go check up on your friend. Ok. That's fine. So how did you know I was even here? Your mom called me. So is this Lydia's mom? No, this is a loaner. I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. I was n't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game? Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck. Yeah, they're not so bad. Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me? You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day. Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. This is so great. You wan na explain that? I mean, well,'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting. Where are they? I'm sure they'll be here soon. Yeah, honey, they would n't miss this. Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. You are really frightening me. Somebody wan na help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple? All right, ten centimeters, here we go. All right, honey, time to start pushing. But they're not here yet! I'm sorry, I ca n't tell the baby to wait for them. Oh, god. Ok, got the vent open. Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue! Ben, you ready? All right, gim me your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben. What do you see? Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. Phoebs, It's open! It's open! Wait! You forgot your legs! Push, push! We're here! Where have you been? Long story, honey. All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this? All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go! Good luck! Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner? Out! All right, he's crowning. Here he comes. Let me see, I got ta see, I got ta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this? Not.... helping! You're doing great, you're doing fine. Hello! Oh, sorry. What do you see? What do you see?

No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. How' bout Ben? I like Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? We uh, we just cooked it up. That's what we were off doing. Hi. Hey. Can we come in? I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody. Susan, he looks just like you. Thanks. Oh, god, I ca n't believe one of us actually has one of these. I know, I still am one of these. Ross, can I? The head, the head. You got ta... Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I... I will always have gum. Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. He is so amazing. Oh, I know. Look at him. Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I do n't think that's his name. Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes. He does n't do much, does he? No, this is pretty much it. You guys wan na get some coffee? Yeah. All right, I'll see you guys later. Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again. \n","And here's little Ben nodding off... Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy! Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut! Oh, let me see! Oh, God, is Ben just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss Ben all over! That would be nice. Pardon?

What, you think I'm gon na tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? Man's got a point. Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. Crazy bitch. Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean. Joey... we always know what you mean. Hey. Hey. Hey. How long did you think this barbecue was gon na last? I'm going to China. Jeez, you say one thing, and... You're going to China? Yeah, i - it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they do n't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gon na be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wan na reach me, y - you ca n't. So here's my itinerary. Um... here's a picture of me... Oh, let me see! : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he does n't forget me? Yeah. Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gon na be very fun. Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. Oh. Hey, who's Carl? You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. No. Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the... At the coffeehouse, right. So you do know who he is! Sorry. OK, I'm gon na go say goodbye to the guys. Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. Hi. Hey! Hey!.... I have to go to China. The country?

How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? Forget about her. He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. Course there, they just call it food. Yeah... I guess. I don'tI do n't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. I know. We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves' The Three Basketeers.' Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. Ooooh. OK, how does everybody like their burgers? Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up? Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gon na... complete the transaction, if you know what I... Then you do. Heh, heh. So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her? What do you mean? Y'know, just be there for her. Not following you. Think about it. OK, I'm guessing this is from... Well, thank you, Melanie. OK, this one right here is from me. OK... ah, it's light...... it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...... it's a book! Oh, it's Dr. Seuss! : That book got me through some tough times. There is a little child inside this man! Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. Who's this from? Oh, that's Ross's. Oh...... Oh my God. He remembered. Remembered what? It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I ca n't believe he remembered! Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. I ca n't believe he did this. Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? ahem... um... Crystal duck. No, no, no.... the, um, the...' love' part? F - hah.... flennin.... Oh.... my God. Oh, no - no - no - no - no.... That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. I mean, this is unbelievable. I know. This is really, really huge. No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. Nuh - uh. I do n't think any of our lives are ever gon na be the same ever again. OK, is there a mute button on this woman? I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D - did you have any idea? No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W - well, what else did Ross Geller say? I mean, does Ross Geller, like, want to go out with me? Well, given that Ross Geller's desperately in love with you, he probably would n't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to Ross Geller. H - Ross Geller's in China! The country. No, no, wait. His flight does n't leave for another forty - five more minutes. What about the time difference? From here to the airport? Yes! You're never gon na make it! Rachel, what're you gon na say to Ross Geller? I-I-I do n't know. Well then maybe you should n't go. He's right, cause if you're just gon na, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. I do n't know. Maybe I'll know when I see Ross Geller. Here, look, alright, does this help? Noooo... look, all I know is that I can not wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just got ta talk to Ross Geller. I... I got ta... OK, I'll see you later. Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! Alright! Ni - chou chi - ma! Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... Hi! Hi. May I see your boarding pass? Oh, no, no, I do n't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, Ross Geller's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j - just... No no no! Federal regulations! OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give Ross Geller a message for me? Please? This is very important. Alright. What's the message? Uh... I do n't know. Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you. What? It's from Rachel. She said that Rachel Green loved the present, and Rachel Green will see you when you get back. : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I do n't know what Flight Attendant's talking about! There's no Rachel! Do n't give me that deep freeze. Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute! Heh, heh. It was nothin'. Well, now we've got ta find something fun for you! Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn. M - Me again? Sure! Why not? Boy, somebody's gon na get a big fruit basket tomorrow. Oooh, I got ta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be. How do you mean? I do n't know, I - I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always' me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman. Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wan na save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gon na go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out? I do n't know. I do n't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. Sure. I do n't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great. Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends - in - law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about Ross Geller! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. Another good point. No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed. Huh? Well, I mean, then what happens if it does n't work out? Why is n't it working out? I do n't know... sometimes it does n't. Is Ross Geller not cute enough for you? No! Does Ross Geller not make enough money? No, I'm just.... Maybe there's someone else. Wha... Is there? Is there someone else? No! There is.. there is noone else! Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? Hey, big... Shhhh!... spender. She's still asleep. So how'd it go? Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. Well, it's like, last night, I could n't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. It was amazing! And not just for Melanie... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. I did n't know you had another level. I know! Neither did I! Hey, great skirt! Birthday present? Yeah. Oh, from who? From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me. Well, it's the thought. Hey, does n't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27 - B? Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea. Oh, why? Because, I feel like I would n't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I do n't wan na... No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... I am not' so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise. Who is it? It's me, Carl. C'mon up. Behind my brother's back?... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you wo n't be hearing from me. Seven hundred bucks! Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. Really? So, you're gon na stick with this' it's all for her' thing? What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gon na shoot myself! I mean, do n't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! I ca n't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. Fine, just stop thinking about me. Ca n't do it, can you? So I'm thinking about you. So what? I do n't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway? Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy.... I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. Ross, it's too hard. No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I - I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. Ross, you're like my best friend. I know. If we broke up, and I lost you... Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gon na break up? Well, have you been involved with someone where you have n't broken up? No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? I do n't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. Well, start looking. Wow. Exactly! And you just know I'm gon na be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! Right! You're right! Heh... y'know? You know what? What? I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I got ta go. I'm sorry. But... Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! Oh, hey, hey, I got that. Oh, thanks, sweetie. No problem. I can not wait for you to meet my friends. Really? Yeah. You do n't think they'll judge and ridicule me? No, no, they will. I just... uh... Ca n't wait. Come on, they're gon na love you. \n","Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell Rachel Green, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \" forget about her \" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \" Oh my god. \" So she went to the airport to meet Ross Geller when he came back, but what Rachel Green did n't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been? Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! Rach! Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? It was, it was great. Oh, what happened? What? You're bleeding. I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wan na hear everything! Everything. Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel. These are, these are n't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country. Thank you. I'm from New York. Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. No way! I'm telling you, Rachel Green went to the airport, and Rachel Green's gon na go for it with Ross! Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? Um, this? Yes. Guys, you got your hair cut. Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.' Cause, you know, if you do n't look good, we do n't look good. I love that voice. Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around Julie. Cramp, cramp. Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs. You, you, you said Ross Geller liked me. You, you slowpokes! That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up? What up?! Everyone, this is Julie. Julie. Ohh. Hi! Hi, but I'm not here, you have n't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I do n't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. And bus. Oh my god. The screaming guy? And the spitting? You got ta hear this story. We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old... 200 at least.... and this guy... And the chicken pooped in Julie lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, did n't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about. This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen? Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. But we have n't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. Julie! Julie, is n't that great? I mean, is n't that just kick - you - in - the - crotch, spit - on - your - neck fantastic? It's an expression. Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gon na go see the baby. And then we've got ta get some sleep. Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time. Well, listen, do n't tell us what's gon na happen though,'cause I like to be surprised. Bye. Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Hey, Rach, can I get... Did you talk to him? Not yet. Then, no. So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gon na happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? God? It was you, pal. Well, maybe it was God, doing me. Look, you were right. Rachel Green looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I do n't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it had n't been for you. Well, you owe me one, big guy. Here's your lemonade. I did n't order lemonade. Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gon na charge you for that. But... Go - go - go - go, come on! So uh, what did you find out? He said... he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wan na see it, is that Ross Geller made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever. How is that the silver lining? You have to really wan na see it. Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking? Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? No, although now that's what I'm thinking. All right, so what were you thinking? Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? Ohh! No. Why not? Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak. No you're not. I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. Hello? Hi. Hi. Anybody know a good tailor? Needs some clothes altered? No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk. Why do n't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. Frankie did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No,' scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990? Okay. You have to stop the Q - tip when there's resistance! Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you did n't hang up either. She did n't hang up either! Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y... Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. Rachel! I'll just call her back. Okay! Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected... Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I ca n't have. Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too. I know you did. I'm just gon na deal with it, I'm just gon na deal with it. I got ta get out of here. Ok, I do n't care what you guys say, something's bothering Rachel Green. You know, I think I was sixteen. Please, just a little bit off the back. I'm still on \" no. \" Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec? No - no - no - no - no, I'm not fallin' for that again. What's goin' on? Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. What stupid thing did you do? Bon giorno tutti! Ewww! Ok, Paulo, why do n't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye - bye. Rachel, how did this happen? I do n't know, I just kinda ran into Paulo last night. Where? At his apartment. Is this juice? Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped Paulo because he hit on Phoebe? Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser. Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. People do stupid things when they're upset. My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I had n't..., but this is about your horrible mistake. Hi! Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching. Hey, hey Ross. Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here? I do Raquel. So, uh, Paulo's back. Yeah, Paulo's back. Is that a problem? No, not a problem. Good! I'm glad it's not a problem. Ok, you're gon na have to not touch my ass. Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered. Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell Frankie Joey Tribbiani says hello. Frankie'll know what it means. Are you sure Frankie's gon na be able to crack that code? You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control - y and bossy and Monica about it. I promise. All right. Now some of you are gon na get cut, and some of you are n't. But I promise none of you are gon na feel a thing. All right, that's it, I quit. What? I did n't say anything. Yeah, but this is n't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, does n't trust a person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how Dudley Moore wears it. How who wears it? Demi Moore. Demi Moore is not a he. Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten. That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore. Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore? Demi Moore's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost! Oh, Demi Moore's got gorgeous hair. I know! How long do you want the cuffs? At least as long as I have the pants. I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam. How is she? It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. How's the hair? I'm not gon na lie to you, Ross, it does n't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. Can we see her? Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why do n't you come on in. Yeah. How're you doing? I'm okay. Ooh, that bad, huh? What? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts. When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me. You got ta tell Ross how you feel. Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie? What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. I do n't know, I do n't know. Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man! Frankie? What're you talking about? Hey, what's goin' on? Joey's tailor... took advantage of me. What? No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years. Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... What? Cupping. That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Is n't that how they measure pants? Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you? What? That's not? Oh my God. Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better. I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. Thank you. My hair is very amused. Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. Thank you. Well, I got ta go. Bye. Bye, Rach. Wait, are you leaving? Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by \" bye! \" Well, can I talk to you for a sec? Okay. Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... That's ok. What's goin' on? Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I would n't. Um, second of all, what? Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot? No. No - no - no - no. Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI - I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. Really? You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking \" Oh my god, I'm with Rachel \". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all? No, I think that was the whole all. Okay. Okay. Okay. I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants. I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut? Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that. Really? You wan na do it right now? Great! Ok, I just wan na be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right? No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes. Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you. You're welcome. \n","Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know Ben's gon na grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I could n't resist. Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for Ben? Oh, is Ben hungry already? I guess so. You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. I got ta get one, too. What are you guys doing? We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world. Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gon na happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. Carol? Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast - feeding? Sure. Uh, does it hurt? It did at first, but not anymore. Chandler? So, uh, how often can you do it? As much as he needs. Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if Ben blows into one, does the other one get bigger? Rachel, do you have any muffins left? Yeah, I forget which ones. Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? No thanks. Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. Thank you. What a bitch. Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and Julie's friend wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it? I ca n't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet. Ok, um, I'll go with you. Great. Hi, honey. Hey, sweetums. Hello to the rest. Hi! Monica what're you doin'? You ca n't go shopping with Julie? What about Rachel? It's gon na be a problem, is n't it? Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in Rachel Green house of worship. But I'm... Monica, Rachel Green will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow? Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal. It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. Woof, woof. Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle. Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy? Who? Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man. Hombre? What's he doin' in my section? I guess Hombre Man does n't know. Well, Hombre Man's gon na. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'? Mornin'. Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory. Your territory, huh? Yeah. Bijan for men? No thanks. Hombre? Yeah. All right. You were saying? Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. What? We were shopping, and we had lunch. Oh, all right. What did I have? You had a salad. Oh, no wonder I do n't feel full. Hey, guys, what's up. I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad. Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur. You went shopping for fur? Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs. You bought boobs? Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras. Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee. Oh, actually I sorta have plans. Ready, Annabelle? You bet. Maybe some other time? Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?! Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he wo n't sleep. Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. Honey, relax. Ross is great with Ben. Do n't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. Oh, this is so cute. Oh, I got that for him. My mommies love me. That's clever. Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. Did you just say Hi, Jew? Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, Eddie Moskowitz likes it. Reaffirms his faith. Ben, dinner! Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you did n't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that. Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk. So? Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person. What is the big deal? What did you just do? Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? You wo n't even taste it? No! Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. Hey, where is everybody? They took Ben to the park. Where've you been? Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket. Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Okay. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars? You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card. And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket? That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent. Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with? Judy. Who? Julie. What?! Jody! You were with Julie? Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to Julie because Julie was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were... shopping. Oh. Oh my God. Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did n't mean anything to me. Yeah, right. Sure! Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out! Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. That is not true! Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with Julie to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I do n't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. Hey! How did we do? Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. I did not freak out. Why'd you freak out? Because it's breast milk. It's gross. My breast milk is gross? This should be fun. No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just do n't think breast milk is for adults. Of course the packaging does appeal to grown - ups and kids alike. Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. That would be no. Come on. It does n't taste bad. Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. You've tasted it? You've tasted it. Uh huh. Oh, you've tasted it. You can keep saying it, but it wo n't stop being true. Gim me the bottle. Gim me the towel. Howdy. Gim me a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wan na put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This is n't supposed to mean anything to you. I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I do n't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gon na come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gon na run? Yeah I guess you're right. You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. I'm gon na do it. All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and Miss Kitty'll fix you up with a nice hooker. I do n't know what else to say. Well that works out good, because I'm not listening. I feel terrible, I really do. Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife? Rachel, say that I'm friends with Julie, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible? Yes. It's that terrible? Yes. Monica, you do n't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, Julie's actually, but now she's actually stealing you. Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with Julie does n't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my... We're, we're... Oh, I love you. I love you too. You guys, um I know that this really does n't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that. Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she did n't do anything wrong. I mean, Julie was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave Julie a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me? I'd do anything for you, you know that. I'd do anything for you. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Mornin'. I said, mornin'. I heard ya. All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready? Ready. Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing! Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do? I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. My god, what happened? These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all... stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? Sure. So. So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right? I know, I probably should n't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. Really? Me? Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you do n't. Well, you're not totally paranoid. Oy. Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gon na bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right. Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. I'd love it too. Shoot, I got ta go. So, I'll talk to you later. All right, Julie. Bye. Bye. What a manipulative bitch. That's not bad. \n","Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I got ta go, I got ta go, I got ta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gon na get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys. Hi. Hi, hi can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does Phoebe Buffay still live here? Uh, no Phoebe Buffay does n't but I can, I can get a message to Phoebe Buffay. Great. Uhh, just tell Phoebe Buffay her husband stopped by. What? Hey, how, how did you do that? This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married? Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and Duncan's gay and he's just from Canada and Duncan just needed a green card. I ca n't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything. I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve. Of course I would n't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? You see, and you thought Monica Geller'd be judgemental. OK, I was n't in love with Duncan and I was just helping out a friend. Please, when Duncan left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. Huuh. Well, did n't you? I might have. I ca n't believe you did n't tell me. Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. What have I not told you? Oh, I do n't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace. What! Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat. I did n't know it was a big secret. Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I do n't know, having a third nipple. You have a third nipple? You bitch. Whip it out, whip it out. C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless. Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? I ca n't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? I do n't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. Joey was in a porno movie. Huuh. If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me. You were in a porno? Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I could n't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but ca n't'cause there's people havin' sex on it. That is wild. So what's it shaped like? Yeah, is there a hair on it? What happens if you flick it? So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia. You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you do n't know? Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special. Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But Ross Geller's with her now and you're just gon na have to get over it. Ohh, I'm gon na have to get over it. God, see I did n't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it. Woah. Foxy lady. Where you goin'? Um, I'm gon na go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades. The Ice Capades? No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns are n't as fast but when Snoopy falls... funny. I ca n't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again. OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha... OK sweetie, I'll see you later. See you later Rach. Bye - bye Julie. Hey. Hey. Hey, c'mon, cut it out. Hey? What? Can I ask you somethin'? Sure. Naa. What? C'mon, talk to me. OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex? Why? Who's not having... Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? Technically, huh, no. Wow. Is it, is it'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it'cause Julie's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? No, no, Julie's great and it's not like we have n't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh... No, no no no, do n't need to know the details. It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I... Well, you just must think I'm weird. No, no, no, no I do n't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? What? I think it's sexy. Sexy? Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. No kidding? Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? What? I'd wait. You'd wait? Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait... then I'd wait some more. Really? Oh yeah, I do n't care how much she tells you Julie wants it, I do n't care if begs, Julie pleads, she tells you Julie, Julie's gon na have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. Women really want this? More than jewelry. Hi. Phoebe! Ta - da. Hey. Hi. Ahh, look at you, you look great. Do I? Thank you, so do you. Thanks. Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice. You always said I'd make it. Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo. I missed you. I'm gon na get changed. OK. Um, now. Phoebs. Oh, right, OK. Ole. What? Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha. Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. Uh, Julie. Yeah? Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. Hi everyone. Hi. I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. Oh, God, no problem. So you're gon na go with the uh, waiting thing? Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. What did, what did Joey Tribbiani say? Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what Joey Tribbiani said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so... What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. Pop it in. I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. What's wrong with people having sex? Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here. Hell, I wan na see Joey. So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right... oh, never mind. OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen. All I say is, she better get the job. Looks to me like he's the one getting the job. Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I ca n't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do... so I just watch' em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray. Nice work my friend. Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am... So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday. Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce. Ohh... K. How come? Umm, actually, I'm getting married again. What? Oh God, I do n't know how to tell you this. I'm straight. Huuh. Yeah, I know, I. I, I do n't, I do n't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties. I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you ca n't live a lie anymore. So how long have you known? Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in. And um, and there's actually a, a woman? Her name's Debra. Oh. Well is Debra, is Debra the first that you've been with? Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. Sure. But now I know I do n't have a choice about this, I was born this way. I, I do n't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says,' Oh, I'm not gay.' I'm, I'm still me. Why could n't you have just figured this out six years ago? You know, it still smells like monkey in there. That saves us a conversation. Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. Me too, we should get goin'. No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. Rachel, that's all we do. Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie? What about Julie? Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we do n't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what do n't you like? We wan na hear everything. Well, that could take a while. So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? I got the time to get to know Julie. I got time. Rach, I know Julie pretty well, can I go? That's fine. OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like? Well, in a nutshell... Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh. So, um, have you told your parents? No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so... Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who... no, um, I'm sorry, do n't tell me, I do n't th ink either answer would make me feel better. I love you Phoebe. So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously. And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb. Mrs., Mrs. Gobb? No Cobb, as in cobb salad. Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? I'm goin' home. What? Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? Goodnight. So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on... Oh, no no, I am. Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous? Um, no, I uh, I have done it before. Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gon na handle it. I mean, are, are ya gon na, are ya gon na talk about it before hand, are you just gon na pounce? I uh, I do n't know, I guess I'm just gon na see, see what happens. OK, gook luck. Wha, uhh, what? Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time does n't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. OK, now I'm nervous. Maybe you should put it off. No, no, I do n't wan na put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just do n't wan na, I do n't wan na mess it up, ya know. I know, yeah, sorry. What, it's not your fault. Maybe it, maybe it does n't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that. Really? Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I do n't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. Uh-huh. And then, I do n't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. Ohh... Thanks Rach, goodnight. Ohh, God. Good morning. Well, somebody got some last night. Twice. \n","Man, I sure miss Julie. Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. You ever figure out what that thing's for? No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I do n't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I do n't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? What? I got a little drunk... and naked. Bob here. What've you been up to? Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love Jane. I know. I'm back. So, are we gon na get together or what? Um, absolutely. Uh, how' bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five - ish? Great, I'll see you then. Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when Jane sees you tomorow, she's probably gon na realize, \" hey, you're not Bob. \" I'm hoping that when Bob does n't show up, Jane will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. Oh my god. You are pure evil. Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico. Hi, Julie! Hi, Julie. Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday. Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20? Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake. Do we need a cake? Look guys, I know it's a little steep. Yeah, whoosh! But it's Ross. It's Ross. All right. I'll see you guys later, I got ta go... do a thing. Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gon na go through with this, are you? You know, I think I might just. So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight? Well I guess I got ta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies. Can you believe how much this is gon na cost? Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just do n't get that we do n't make as much money as they do? Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \" let's go here, let's go there \". Like we can afford to go here and there. Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it,' cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross. For Ross. For Ross, Ross, Ross. Oh my god. Hey. Hi. What? I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. If it's not you, this is a horrible story. Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice. Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney? I'm tellin' you. You ca n't do this. Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods. That does n't matter. Jane wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who Jane was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness. We do n't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. Go over there and tell that woman the truth. All right. Go. Hi. Hi. Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something. Yes? Whoever stood you up is a jerk. How did you --? I do n't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? Thanks. No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly - appointed head lunch chef -- Who is also in charge of purchasing. Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing -- Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there. Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister -- Oh, wait, and I got a beeper! Cool. Let's see! That's fine, I'll just wait! Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Monica! Are we ready to order? Oh, you know what, we have n't even looked yet. Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat. Wow, look at these prices. Yeah, these are pretty ch - ching. What are these, like famous chickens? Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade? Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine? Oh, see, I had to tell Jade that my number was your number, because I could n't tell Jade that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number. Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls? Do I dare ask? Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. That sounds great. Same for me. And for the gentleman? Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper? You'd think, would n't you? Miss? Ok, I will have the uh, side salad. And what will that be on the side of? Uh, I do n't know. Why do n't you put it right here next to my water? And for you? Um, I'm gon na have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care. I will have the uh, Cajun catfish. Anything else? Yes, how' bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gon na sneeze on my fish, are n't you? Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks. Um, everyone? Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Monica's big night, she should n't pay. Oh, thank you! So five of us is, $ 33.50 apiece. No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gon na happen. Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback. I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty - something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just... Ok, Pheebs! How' bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal. Not for you. All right, what's goin' on? Ok, look you guys, I really do n't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable. Fine. All right, fine. Yeah. You can tell us. Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine. Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys do n't get that uh, we do n't have as much money as you. Ok. I hear ya. We can talk about that. Well, then... Let's. I, I just never think of money as an issue. That's'cause you have it. That's a good point. So um, how come you guys have n't talked about this before?' Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. Wha --? Whoa, hey, I do n't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative -- there's gon na be a hoopla? Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing. If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. G - gift? The thing's not the gift? No, the thing was, we were gon na go see Hootie and the Blowfish. Hootie and the -- oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio. No, now I feel bad. You wan na go to the concert. No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together. All of us. Together. Not at the concert. Ok. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. So, the ebola virus. That's got ta suck, huh? Gee, Monica, what's in the bag? I do n't know, Chandler. Let's take a look. Oh, it's like a skit. Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. Whoo! Cool. Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank - you. But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope? By the way, this did n't seem so dorky in the hall. Come on. Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish! It's on us, all right, so do n't worry. It's our treat. So... Thank you. Could you be less enthused? Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like -- Like? Charity. Charity? We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here. Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. Actually, it makes us feel that big. I do n't, I do n't understand. I mean, you, it's like we ca n't win with you guys. If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel. Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel. Ok, we never should a talked about this. I'm just gon na pass on the concert,'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now. Me neither. Me too. Guys, we bought the tickets. Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. Why did you look at me when you said that? Well, I guess now we ca n't go. What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together? You know what? You're right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. All right. We're gon na go. It's not for another six hours. We're gon na go then. Chandler! Yeah? Geez! Are you ready? Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. Whoa! You had sex today? Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting Jane lip to stop from screaming. Wow. Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign. Still doing the screening thing? I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you did n't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy. Bob here. Oh, hi. So, uh, you met someone, huh? Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. So, uh, how was Chandler Bing? Eh. Eh? Oh, Bob, Chandler Bing was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. Well, that makes me feel so good. It was just so awkward and bumpy. Bumpy? Well, maybe Chandler Bing had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it. Well there really was n't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? You know what? I'm not gon na be able to enjoy this. Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. So, let's go. Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now. You know, the guys are probably having a great time. Come on you guys, one more time. Ok. One. Nooo. That was amazing! Excellent, that was excellent. I ca n't believe the guys missed this. What guys? Oh, yeah. Excuse me, you're Monica Geller are n't you? Do I know you? You used to be my babysitter. Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been? Good, good, I'm a lawyer now. You ca n't be a lawyer.

How was yours? Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him? Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad? Uh, good. Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust. Yeah, we really missed you guys. Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid. We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get -- is that a hickey? No, I just, I fell down. On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey? You know, a party, or -- What party? It was n't so much a party as... a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band. You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish? Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this. Who gave you that hickey? That would be the work of a Blowfish. Oh! Oh! I ca n't believe it. I ca n't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \" hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck \". Look, do n't blame us. You guys could a been there, you know. What, as part of your poor friends outreach program? It's work. I do n't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gon na feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. And we do n't work hard? Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page. I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more. And you feel like we hold you back. Yes. Oh! No. Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I do n't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired. Oh. Here's your check. That'll be $ 4.12. Let me get that. You got five bucks? Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. Stephanie's supposed to be very good. But what about Phoebe? Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, Phoebe Buffay makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around. Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you can not do this to her. Uh -- Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her? Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed. You know, I do n't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?

That's why we're always saying \" Terry's a jerk! \" That's where that came from. Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. Ok, you know what, lem me, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why do n't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever - her - name - is. I mean, you wo n't even be here. You do n't pay her. It's not gon na cost you anything.

I see someone's having an allergic reaction. Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. Tho? Ohhh. That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's got ta be a needle. You're just gon na have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me? Ok. Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wan na squeeze my hand?

Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well. Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really,'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better. Do you? No. This whole like playing - for - money thing is so not good for me. You know, I do n't know, when I sang \" Su - Su - Suicide \", I got a dollar seventy - five. But then, \" Smelly Cat \", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat. Well, you know, honey, I do n't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money. Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \" Smelly Cat \". Really? From who? Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency. Yeah. Here you go. Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it! I just wan na thank you for being there for me today.

Oh. Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin? Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? No. But I remember people telling me about it. I hope Ben has a little sister. Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass. I'm gon na get a new band - aid. Hey, how' bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken? That was you? They, uh, were infected. He would n't have made it. Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben.

Do I not look fun enough? Is there something... repellant... about me? So, how was the party? Well it could n't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive? No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting. Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight? No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation. Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wan na work out? I can remake you. Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time. Please. C'mon. Let her.

Sorry Phoebs. Look, I, y'know, I do n't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know Scott Alexander's really interesting and Scott Alexander's really sweet and why wo n't he give it up?

Oohh, um, no, I do n't think that's the problem.' Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something. Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look? No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell. Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes. Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it. Ooh, oh, Rachel, do n't look. What? C'mon you guys, I do n't care, I have a date tonight. Woah, woah, woah, you have a date? Yeah, Monica's settin' me up. But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh...?

Ross Geller can press her up against that window as much as Ross Geller wants. For all I care, Ross Geller can throw Julie through the damn thing. Hi guys. Hey. Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK? Only if you say his full name. Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy. Alright.

How long do cats live? I'm sorry? Cats, how long do they live figuring you do n't... y'know, throw' em under a bus or something? Um, maybe 15, 16 years. That's just great. Um, cheers. Oh, right, clink. Monica told you I was cuter that this, did n't Monica Geller? Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend. Oh, that does sound... Ahh. I mean Ross Geller just started going out with Julie. Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend? Ah, hah - hah - hah - ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you. Alright. OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend? So, I figured it out. What? Why Scott does n't want to sleep with me. It's'cause I'm not sexy enough. Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, \" Excellent butt, great rack. \" Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet. Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gon na have to ask Scott Alexander. You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why ca n't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called? Fruitflies? Yes! Thank you. So, would you like any dessert? No! No dessert, just a check, please. Oh, you're not having fun, are you?

Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over Ross Geller. gosh, why ca n't I do that? Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gon na be fine. You just ca n't see it now because you have n't had any closure. Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why did n't I think of that? How do I get that? Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, \" I'm over you. \" Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel... woo Hang on. Hello, excuse me. What. Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute. I'm talkin'! I can see that.

Just waiting for the beep. Good. Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday. Why not? Because it's Sunday. It's God's day. OK, if you say stop, then we stop. OK, stop. No, c'mon, we ca n't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go.

Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say... What? Why, why are you looking at me like that? I do n't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I do n't remember. OK. Oh, oh, oh. Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me? No, I stayed at Julie's last night. Huh. Oh, actually I have n't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages? Oh yeah, go ahead. Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael? Oh my God.

When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh... What? Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. You've had feelings for me? Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first. Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know? Chandler told me. Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did Chandler Bing? When you were in China. China. Meeting Julie. Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gon na stand. I'm gon na stand, I'm gon na walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me? Are you over me? That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie. Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting. I'll be right down. Wait, so, you're going? Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I ca n't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gon na go get a cat. OK, OK. Cat. Hey Joey. Hey Phoebs. How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar? I ca n't find the remote. Thank you. So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did. And? And we did. All right Phoebs, way to go. Yay me. So, so how did it happen? Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on. And what did he say? He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gon na get all, y'know, like,' ohh, is he gon na call me the next day' and, y'know,' where is this going' and, ya know, blah - la - la - la - la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious. Wow. Yeah, so I said, \" OK, relax please, \" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking... I convinced him. Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. Um - hum. This man is my God. Hi. I did n't get a cat. Oh, that's um, interesting. No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. Alright, I got it Ross. You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. What? I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? Then you should have said something before I met her. I did n't know then. And how come you never said anything to me. There was never a good time. Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night. Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I did n't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys. Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point? The point is I... I do n't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it. Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. Fine.' Cause I do n't need your stupid ship. Good. Good. And ya know what, now I've got closure. Try the bottom one. Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over. No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'. OK, I do n't, I do n't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so do n't make me do anything that I'll regret. Ooh, what'cha gon na do, fat boy, huh? What? Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have. Well, thanks. I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work. Well, you know. You know, I mean, you ca n't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed. Uh-huh. And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on. Well no, but um. I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all. Y'know, I try to stay positive... So, you feel like goin' for a run? Alright. Because, you know, you do n't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here. OK. Just for a little while. OK. \n","Ross kissed me. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! It was unbelievable! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues? Oh, it ended very well. Oh. Do not start without me. Do not start without me. Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a \" I got ta have you now \" kind of thing? Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it. Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back? No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair. Ohhhh. And, uh, and then I kissed her. Tongue? Yeah. Cool. All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built - in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s. Wow. What are you gon na use it for? Games and stuff. There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me. Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked? There's an ad for a naked chef? No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... Hi. Hey, oh, so, um... how'd you make out last night? That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful Wait a minute. I thought last night was great. Yeah, it was, but... I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gon na throw all that away? You got all that from saline solution? We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel. Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and...... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Hey, you. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Hi, honey. Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you? Good. Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gon na play something, Phoebe? Oh, well, actually. Play it. Ok, all right. Hey, Julie, I did n't know you wore lenses. What? Ssshh. Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, \" Two of Them Kissed Last Night \". There was a girl, we'll call Rachel Green Betty, and a guy let's call Ross Geller Neil. Now I ca n't stress this point too strongly, this story is n't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who Ross Geller loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju... Loolie? Ross Geller must decide, he must decide, even though I made Ross Geller up, he must decide! This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo. So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad was n't too clear. Mockolate. I'm sorry? Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute. Ohh. Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate. All right. Mmm - mmm. Yeah? I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate does n't do that. No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food - preparation holidays : Easter, Christmas, what have you. Mmm - mmm. But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday. Wow. Are n't you going to swallow that? Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. Yeah, is n't that great? Mmm. Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving - themed recipes. You think you might be interested? Abso...... lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate. Really? Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas. How about Mockolate mousse? It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving - y. Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse? What makes it pilgrim? We'll put buckles on it. Hey. Hey. Hey. Did uh, Ross call? No, I'm sorry. Why did n't Ross Geller call? He's gon na stay with Julie, is n't he? Ross Geller's gon na stay with Julie and she's going to be all, \" Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gon na to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together. \" No offense, but that sounds nothing like Julie. I do n't know what to do. What am I gon na do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare. Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight. Hey, here's a thought, Ross. Do n't touch the computer. Do n't ever touch the computer. Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column. Ca n't we just use a pen? No, Amish boy. Ok, let's start with the cons,'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first. I do n't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say Rachel Green's a little spoiled sometimes. You could say that. And I guess, you know, sometimes, Rachel Green's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress. Waitress. Got it. You guys wan na play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else? I do n't know. Oh, her ankles are a little chubby. Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her? She's not Rachel. Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served. Oh my god. Oh my god good? Oh my god, I ca n't believe you let me put this in my mouth. Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like! I'm telling you this thing wo n't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek? Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart? Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing. So, Spock actually hugs his father? Hey, do you guys have...... hi. Hi. Where you goin'? I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's. Oh. No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing. Well, what's the other thing, what do I think? Well, uh. He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. Really? Really. It's always been you, Rach. Oh, god. Ohhh. Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good. I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them? Let me get my coat. Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat. Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I ca n't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that? What? Nothing. What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it? No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing! Well what is it? Let me see. Hey, someone order a coat? Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he wo n't let me see. He wo n't? He wo n't! Because, is n't that, is n't that the, the short story you were writing? Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing. And I'm in it? Then let me read it. No! Come on. Hey, uh, why do n't you read it to her? Alright. \" It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch.' Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end. \" That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world. All right, you know what? This is n't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it. No, you do n't. All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. What is this? Ross, what is this? Good luck. Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok? Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled? Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type \" little \", the idiot. Just a waitress? No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach? Oh! I do not have chubby ankles! No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column. She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I would n't know because I'm just a waitress. No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra -- Rachel? My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told Rachel Green it was my diary, Rachel Green never would have made me read her my diary. You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency. I... I can not believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus. Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea. What? What? Oh good, I was hoping that would come up. This was your idea? What were you thinking? All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason. Yeah. You! All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, do n't you? Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle. Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please! When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That does n't mean please climb up the fire escape. I just wan na read something. It's your pro list. Not interested. Ok, ok, number one : The way you cry at game shows. Number two : how much you love your friends. Number three : the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four : how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five : how great you are with Ben. Number six : the way you smell. Hey, Ross! What are you doin'? Hey, Joey. You wan na open the window? Oh, yeah, I do. What are you doing out there? I am, uh, I am... Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate? Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance. No. No? That's what I said. Look, maybe we should go? No, you guys, you really do n't have to go, we're done talking. Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel. No, you do n't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you. No, but, but I wan na be with you in spite of all those things. Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said do n't go! You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you. Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list. I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer. Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate. Does n't matter. What? Our FDA approval did n't come through. Something about laboratory rats. Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you did n't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you? Well, uh, I ate some. Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it does n't burn when you pee, does it? Hello? Hi. Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down. Listen, I... I do n't think this is the best time. Look, can, can you do something for me? Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music? The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I do n't wan na play your song anymore. Why do n't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out. Hi, thanks for coming in again. Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash. It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called \" fishtachios \". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you? Cat hair. Oh, sorry. \n","Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year? Yeah, we were gon na give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we do n't wan na look bad. Oh, actually this year we just made Mr. Adelman homemade cookies. And twenty - five it is. You gave Mr. Adelman cookies? Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares... Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that. I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick. Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies? Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them. So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies? Uhh, the mailman, the super. Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy. Oh my God. What? Uhhh, I do n't think you're gon na like this. Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section. Oh look, and Man 1 did my crossword puzzle. Yeah, but not very well, unless 14 - across,' Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme. I ca n't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'. Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year. Hey guys. Hey. Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present... I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh. Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's... just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole... Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me? How' bout from now on we just call it the' unfortunate incident'? Hey Gunther, you got stairs in your place? Yeah. Here, go nuts. Hey guys. Hey. What's in the bag? Um, just some presents. C'mon show us what you bought... You know you want to. OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh. Cute. I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom. Ross, that is gorgeous! Yeah? Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gon na be voted best dressed at the make - believe military academy. Hey. Hey. Hi Phoebe. Happy Christmas Eve Eve. Oh my God, where did you get this? Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings. This is my father, this is a picture of my dad. Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame. No it is n't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you. Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison. No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born. How have you never been on Oprah? OK, look, see, this is Man 1. My mother gave me this picture before Lily Buffay died, same guy. Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie. It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. Oh, wait a minute honey. Phoebs. Wow. So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me... Joey! Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears! Esther Livingston. Gone. Hi, Phoe. Hi Gram. What cha doin'? Oh, just updating the phonebook. Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again? Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come? Just, you know, to see... um. Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here Man 2 is at a graduation... another graduation... another graduation. OK, is this really my father? Is it really your fa -- I ca n't... well of course it is. OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's'cause someone's pants are on fire. Look, I... Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. Oh God. It was your mother's idea. Ya know, Lily Buffay did n't want you to know your real father because it hurt Lily Buffay so much when he left, and, I did n't want to go along with it, but, well then Lily Buffay died and, and it was harder to argue with Lily Buffay. Not impossible, but harder. Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, Frank Buffay does n't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones? Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? Honey. Oh. Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real Frank Buffay. Oh. Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. Charles Bing did n't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. Well, that does n't sound like a very merry Christmas. Who said anything about Christmas? Hi. Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet? No, nothin'. I hope she's OK. Yeah, I know exactly what Phoebe Buffay's goin' through. How do you know exactly what she's going through? Phoebe Buffay told us. So whaddya got there Monica? Just some stuff for the party. Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, are n't you supposed to be Christmas shopping? You guys have n't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gon na do? Do n't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that? Oh, by the way Mon, I do n't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just did n't give Judy Geller enough. Monica, pigeons learn faster that you. Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How' bout you make a list about me. Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gon na stand here and make a list of... C'mon Rachel. OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you do n't ever, you do n't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you did n't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said. Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay... OK, um, in Ithica... alright, um, Saratoga... Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you should n't call youself information. Hey. Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name. C'mon now Phoe, do n't still be mad at me. How's it going? Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, Frank Buffay's pretty small, you do the math. Well, I think you're better off without Frank Buffay. Oh honey, I know Frank Buffay's your daddy but, but to me Frank Buffay's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole Lily Buffay Gremlin. No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know. I know. OK, I was n't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I did n't know exactly where Frank Buffay lived. Whattaya mean? He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab. Wow. Thank you. Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab. Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gon na see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial Phoebe here with the cab yet? Yeah, she, Phoebe Buffay brought the invisible cab... hop in. Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7. Hey, do n't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. Hey, here she comes. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gon na have a dad. Eeeshk. Eeeshk. Yeah, big stuff. OK, let's go. OK. Alright, here, you have to hold this. OK. Brake left, gas right? Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet. Where's my seat belt? Oh, no no, that side does n't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. Hey! Hey. C'mon, just tell me, please, please. For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive. Oh, gosh, it's hot in here. Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please? Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and... Ross, the heat! Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is... off. Did you just break the radiator? No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and... here it is. Well put it back. It uhh, it wo n't go back. I'll call the super. Here, let me try. Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal. Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny. Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we ca n't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight. OK, tip the man. No, if Mr. Treeger does n't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gon na be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party. Hey, here's a theme : Come on in, live like bacon. Ooh, this is it, 74. Oh, so that's what this is for. Wow, this is it, I'm gon na meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh. Yeah. Sure is. OK, here I go. I'm goin' in. Alright. Good luck Phoebs. OK, here I go... here I go... I'm goin'. Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom. It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much? Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin.

No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now? No can do, like I told the girl, I ca n't get a new knob until Thursday. Ross. Yeah. Looks like Mr. Treeger's playin' baseball. You mean hardball? Whatever. What'cha gon na' do? Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah.

Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy. Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me' cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter. Well, so why not go knock? Well,' cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I do n't think I'm ready to lose a real one. Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today. Yeah? Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges. Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you. You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping. Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out. Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here! Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down? Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier. Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go. Oh, I could n't go in. Honey, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, yeah, no it's OK' cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now. Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright. Rach, these are for you. Wiper blades. I do n't even have a car. No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. OK, Phoebs, your turn. Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas? Uh-huh. You guuuyys. And for Ross, Mr. Sweet - tooth. You got me a cola drink? And, a lemon lime. Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater. And last but not least. They're ribbed for your pleasure. \n","When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff. Hiiiiii. Are... are you OK? Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th -- Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is Fun Bobby, what. Fun Bobby, Fun Bobby's here, is n't Fun Bobby? Maybe. Do n't toy with me. Geller! Hey, Fun Bobby! Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh? Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister! You and me both. Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon? Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better. Hey, do you need me to pick you up? No, I'm alright man. Really. No, I'm picking you up. Hey no, seriously, I do n't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works. OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gon na go. OK, I'll see you later babe. Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. See ya. Bye! See you later! Fun Bobby is so great. Oh, is n't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with Fun Bobby. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full. Half full of looooovvvvve. And for our two - week anniversary, he's gon na take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend. Cabin of loooooovvvvve. We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. Really? I only had two glasses. I just had a glass. Two. I had one glass. I had about a mugful in this lovely' I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug. OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five? Oooooh. Ooooooh. So what. So Fun Bobby drank a lot tonight. Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I do n't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand. Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how Fun Bobby always starts his stories with, um, OK,' I was soooo wasted,' or,' Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh,' So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.' Monica, have you ever been with Fun Bobby when Fun Bobby was n't drinking? Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo. Rach, does this have nonfat milk? Ehhhummmm, I do n't know, why do n't you taste it. Mmmm, no. Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some. Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish? Um, cake. Yeah, we're gon na... we're gon na get some cake. You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately. Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask. Bobby. Yeah, OK. Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I do n't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you. OK, look, this is n't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I do n't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh...' I'm just a social drinker,' or,' C'mon, it's Flag Day.' So, what are you saying now? I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. Sooo, what's goin' on, huh? I am gon na try and quit drinking. Ooohh, why? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Guess who's back in show business. Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green? No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause Lorne Green's dead. Oh, no. OK, I guess this is gon na seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who. Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives! Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme. Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia. Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gon na do something tonight. Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I... I kinda got plans. You have other friends? Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date. What? With a man? What? What is so strange about me having a date? What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at Ross Geller cause Ross Geller made that list about you? Noooo, no, I'm not mad at Ross Geller. I'm.. I'm not really anything at Ross Geller anymore. What are you talking about? I do n't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not. But you guys came so close. Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gon na have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross. Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ. Hhhhiiiii. Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later. Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition? Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday. Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic? No. Well, here it is. OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady... Oh, is n't Lori a doll? Oh yeah, yeah, Lori's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that Lori was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in. Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gon na put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how' bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, is n't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gon na have to sleep with her. What's the matter? It's Fun Bobby. What, is n't he sober? Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason. Ohhh, OK. Alright, here you go, sweetie. Thanks. You wan na hear something funny? Oh God, yes! There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village. That is funny. I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village. Ahhh, hey honey? Do n't you have to be at your interview now? Oh yeah. See you guys. Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby. Oh.... my... God. It's not that bad. Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story? OK, OK, do n't get all squinky. Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there. But I'm gon na be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I ca n't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me. Alright, do n't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free. Hi. Hey Ross.... bahhhh! Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK? OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend - type.... people. Rachel? Um, hi. Hi. OK, so, you know what you're doing, right? Uhh.... waitressing? Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... does n't.... does n't Russ just remind you of someone? Huh, Bob Saget? Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh. Oh, my, oh! What? What's wrong? I, OK.... She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning. Alright. Listen, Phoebs, this is gon na be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross. Hi. Hi. Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's? Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's? Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date - type... thing... of Rachel's. A date. Yeah, I'm her date. Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date. You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare. Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist. Yes, yes I am. And you are a.... Periodontist. See? They're as different as night and... later that night. Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you. Ditto. I, uh, well... I... I met Russ. Oh. Hey, I did n't know we were, uh, seeing other people. Well, we're not seeing each other, so.... Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal... Well, yeah, this is the deal. OK, well, um, have a nice evening. Um, Russ, you ready? Yeah. Bye. Bye. Bye. She's dating. She's dating. Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating? What do you mean? Do you not see it? See what? I do n't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I do n't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence. Yeah, it's annoying, is n't it?.................... Yeah. Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you did n't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry. Well, the part's mine if I want it. Oh my God! Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady. Oh my... God? Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television. So, what're you gon na do? Well, I guess I could sleep with Lori... I mean, how could I do that? Well, I... I've got a pop - up book that told me everything I need to know. I've never slept with someone for a part. Well is Lori... Sorry. It's alright. Is she good - looking? Yeah, Lori's totally good looking. I mean, if I met Lori in a bar, or something, I'd be buying Lori breakfast. You know, after having slept with her. Y'know, maybe this is n't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas. I just... I just do n't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gon na look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General. Did n't you used to call it the Little Major? Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it. Can I get you something from the bar? Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you. If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it. No, no really. I.. I would n't feel right about it. Just some water. So the light went out in my refrigerator... I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist. Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wan na do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium. Dysprosium. Dysprosium? Try mendelevium. And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine - down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues. You do n't see it? You actually do n't see it? What? OK honey, you're dating Ross. No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ. Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross! Steve... sleeve! OK, noone is named Sleeve. Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing. For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark. You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful. OK, I'm gon na get some more coffee before the pinching and eye - poking begins. I know what your problem is. Oh you do, do you? Um - hum, you're jealous. Of... of what? You're jealous because I'm a real doctor. Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma. Hey, you listen. No, no, let me finish. No, let me finish. No, you let me fini... Hi. Hi. Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! Did Joey say what he was gon na go when he left? No, I do n't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job? I do n't know. Who would I have to sleep with? Me. Why would I have to sleep with you? It's my game. You want the job or not? Hey. Morning. Where ya goin'? Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember? Ooooohhhh. What's with all the bottles of liquor? What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again? Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing. Oh God, even his knock is boring. Hi. I'll be ready in just a second. Uh, can I talk to you a minute? Sure. This is really hard for me to say. Oh God, you fell off the wagon. Oh, no, no, it's about you. What about me? I think you may have a drinking problem. What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes. Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK? Oh... shoot. Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends. OK. Take care. You too. What happened? Well we... we kinda broke up. Awwwwwwww. Does anybody want these? I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant. Hey. Hey! How'd the callback go? It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me. So what'd you do? Well, I could n't do it. I told her I did n't want to get the part that way. Good for you. But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part. So... and? Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes! Allright! Alright... I've got to go shower. Hi. Oh, hey. Hi. I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me. Yeah, I'm sorry man. Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about? Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him. Oh. Hey. Hey! Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing? Um, oh, I do n't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um.... \n","Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh... oh, Ben. Hi! So how did everything go? Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but Ben started it. Well, we've got ta go. Ok. Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. Oh, you and me? Uh, no, Susan and me. The other us. Ok. We're uh, we're getting married. As in, \" I now pronounce you wife and wife \" married? Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you do n't want to. Why would n't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding. Look I just thought that... No no no, I mean, hey, why should n't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I could n't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me! Is your finger caught in that chair? Mmm hmmm. Want us to go? Uh-huh. This is so cool. You're actually gon na be on television. It really hit me last night. I'm gon na be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.. Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and Carol and Susan's caterer's in a full body cast. Yes! They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this is n't a problem for you, is it? Would it matter? Oh, you are so great! Thank you! Are you really not going? I am really not going. I do n't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married? They love each other, and they wan na celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. If you wan na call that a reason. Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor. Ross, I thought you were over this. Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. Did I miss it? Did I miss it? No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Whoa, Mrs. Wallace's pretty. Yeah, and Mrs. Wallace's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell - the - fart acting. I'm sorry, what? What? It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. Oh, ok. There's my scene, there's my scene. \" Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. Is she gon na be all right? I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a.. subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. Nice! That's great! Excellent! For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. That is so good! Do it again! All right, all right. \" Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart! \" That's great. All right, I got ta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. No no, that's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello. Oh, thanks. I could n't uh... Is everything ok? Um, no, huh - uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. Oh my god. That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get. Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman. Oh, honey. Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, Mrs. Adelman probably woke up today and thought, \" ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage. \" Little did she know God was thinking, \" Ok, but that's it. \" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing Mrs. Adelman aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I do n't think it went very far. What do you mean? I think it went into me. God, this is so hard. I ca n't decide between lamb or duck. Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks. Ok, who ordered what? Oh, I believe I had the half - drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? Oh god. I ca n't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just do n't want Mrs. Green to think that because I did n't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know? Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time. Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? I do n't know. I mean, Mrs. Adelman obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up! There Rachel Green is. Mom! Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun. Pretty much. Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten. This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. Oh hello, Ross. Hi, Mrs. Green. So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? Oh Mom! If you did n't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. Believe me, sometimes that happens. This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you. Really? Yes. I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer.' Course, that's before Evelyn Dermer got the lousy face lift. Now Evelyn Dermer looks like Soupy Sales. Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer? I do n't know. Who's Soupy Sales? Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello. Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. You have some life here, sweetie. I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I did n't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? I do. You did n't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. For... me. Well, not just for you. Well, what do you mean? I'm uh, considering leaving your father. All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. Oh god. I think I'm gon na be sick. Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. And you had no idea they were n't getting along? None. They did n't fight a lot? No! They did n't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? In my day, divorce was not an option. Hey, look who's up. I just ca n't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I would n't have to worry about this. Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, Mrs. Green's doing it because Mrs. Green wants to be more like you. Well, then, you know, could n't Mrs. Green have just copied my haircut? You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and Woman 1 told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true. That's him. Damn. My mail order grandfather has n't come yet. Phoebe? Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting. Um, do you wan na sit? Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear? I do n't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left Mrs. Adelman body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. You're saying, my wife is in you? Yeah. Ok, you do n't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? Well, I do n't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that Mrs. Adelman always used to say that before Mrs. Adelman died, Mrs. Adelman wanted to see everything. Everything? Everything. Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. Oh, wait, I remember, Mrs. Adelman also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. Worth a shot, huh? Look at this. These are from Halloween three years ago. Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office? No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \" thank you, but I do n't really need your help \"? Actually, what I think you said was, \" do n't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen. \" Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I do n't think I planned enough time to actually do it. Hey, Mon, you want some help? If you want. Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty. She's still with you? Yeah. I guess she has n't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face. This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? God! All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex? Oh! What's new in sex? The only man I've ever been with is your father. I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I do n't hear anything. I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more. Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I can not have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? No. You want me to talk you out of it? No. Then what? What do you want? I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this. Why on earth would I understand this? You did n't marry your Barry. I did. Oh. All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. Joey, speed it up! I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out. Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wan na see me cry? Sir! No sir! All right, you! No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you do n't help me cook, I'm gon na take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gon na create a new appetizer called \" pigs in Ross \". All right, ball the melon. Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. Hi. How's it going? It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. Fine, whatever. What's the matter? Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. What? You're still gon na pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. Carol, what's the matter? What happened? My parents called this afternoon to say they were n't coming. Oh my god. I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. It's ok. I'm sorry. And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and Susan Bunch said we were n't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I could n't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I do n't know what to do. I uh ca n't believe I'm gon na say this, but I think Susan's right. You do? Look, do you love Susan Bunch? And you do n't have to be too emphatic about this. Of course I do. Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide ca n't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents did n't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it. You're right. Of course you're right. So we're back on? We're back on. You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I ca n't believe I lost 2 minutes. It just seems so futile, you know? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I can not fly. Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. Thank you. Any time. Ross. You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. Would you look at them? Yeah, ca n't help but. How's that pig - in - the - blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I miss Rose. Oh, yeah? I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone. You know, I uh, I could n't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life... how' bout we go get you a drink? Ok, that's so nice. I should n't even bother coming up with a line, right? Hey, Mom? Having fun? Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wan na pursue, but it's nice to know I have options. There's more alcohol, right? How you doin'? Ok. You did a good thing today. Yeah. You wan na dance? No, that's fine. Come on. I'll let you lead. Ok. All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. Ok, which one of us do you think is gon na be the first one to get married? Well, Mon, I was married. Yeah, me, too, technically. I had a wedding. All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion. I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? Is n't Ben in this? Oh, yeah! \n","That commercial always makes me so sad. Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. I can see that,'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin. And the fact that they're both monkeys. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat... all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem. Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got. Rhythm? No, my first fan mail. Alright!' Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh.' Your not - so - secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait,' PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. This was n't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. Hey guys. Hey. Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake? Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. You know I think he will be surprised,' till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, is n't capable of that emotion. Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now. I know, I know. Hello. Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen. Hi Rob Dohnen. I do n't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great. Oh, wow. Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? Oh, I would love to have kids... you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them. Hey, whaddya wan na do for dinner? Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. Hello. It's Erica. Ah, the stalker. Never mind, it's open. Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wan na have a backup plan, though, just in case she is n't a cartoon. Let's get out of here. The one time they're not home. OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she wo n't know it's me'cause we've never met. That's how radio stars escape stalkers. She's comin'. It's me. Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gon na die. Ready? Wait, wait, wait. Hi. Erica. Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. Well, I uh, I ca n't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel. Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. Oh my God, what happened? Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. I ca n't believe this. I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying,' Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. Well, ya know, someone should have called me. I'm sorry. Look, I know this ca n't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. Zoo dollars? Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey has n't just died. Ooohhh. I know. I ca n't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i -, what is she like. Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery? Yeah. Well, she looks the exact opposite of that. And she's not crazy? Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore. Oh my God. Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? Joey Tribbiani can not persue this. Hey, just because this woman thinks Erica Ford can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room does n't mean she's not a person. I mean, does Erica Ford not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? Joey Tribbiani's the one who wants to boff the maniac. You OK? No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear. That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown - ups. Ya know, they just, grown - ups drink their coffee and do their grown - up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gon na kiss me? I was thinkin' about it. OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe Hi Phoebe. OK, um, I'm gon na play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, Woman 1 bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately Woman 1 has n't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw Woman 1 she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is Woman 1 died and some day you will too. La - la - la la la - la - la la la - la - la la... Oh, Drake, is n't it amazing? Yeah it is... what? Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. Who's they? No one. Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them... but I wo n't. Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life - giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that. Oh my God! Someone, Man 1's choking. Is anyone here a doctor? Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore. Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. Uhh, hey look, I do n't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars? It's about your monkey. It's alive. I do n't understand, why did n't you help that man? Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something. No, no no no, you do n't have to tell me anything. You do n't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore? But that's what... I should just be happy to be near you. Hey I - Hey what? That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He - hey. There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you... But do n't. Cause that's another thing that you do n't wan na do, everybody That's another thing that you do n't wan na do. Excellent! Very informative! Not at all inappropriate! Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back. That was great, the kids loved you. Yay, I rock. And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth. You were incredible. But. How did you know there was a but? I sense these things. It was either but or butter. The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. I can do that. Really? Yeah. Because that would be fantastic. What? You wan na kiss me? Thinkin' about it. Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. Buddy, my monkey? Oh, yeah, right. There was a break - in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken. Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. Of course they're gon na say he's dead. They do n't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover - up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? That guy Lipson? Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows? No, I, I only know Lipson. Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside - down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... Buddy, my monkey, my monkey. Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. Of course. Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know. This is unbelievable. So, what is this information worth to you, my friend? Are you trying to get me to bribe you? Maybe. But you already told me everything. Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey. Well, so what're you gon na do? Well, I guess I'm gon na call the beer company and try to find out where he is. That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales. OK, hi again. Hi Phoebe. Today we're gon na start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens! You're the only one who can save her Drake. Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God. Well, there goes my whole belief system. It's Erica. Oh my God, quick turn off the TV. No no no, wait, I wan na see what happens. Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out. Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina? Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro - surgeon. Hey Erica, c'mon in. How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem? Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up? Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh? Who? Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge. It's not what you think, that was... You told me I was the only one. Alright look, that's it. I do n't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor. Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this? Somebody wan na help me out here? Oh, I know, I know. How, how can you be here and there.' Cause it's a television show. Drake, what're you getting at? I'm not Drake. That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin. Is this true? Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. And then he told me he would run away with me, and he did n't. And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. Is all this true? Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you. Oh Hans. Hans... Hans... Yo evil twin. Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care I'll never forget you Hans. OK, alright, the people who threw the water. Fired! Why? The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs. I ca n't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth? No. I see. Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs. No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur? I'm not saying you have to be Barney. Who's Barney. Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan. You're kidding. This is amazing. I know. I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies. OK, Rachel, I'm ready. OK. Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth? Um, yeah I guess that's me. She's here. Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la - la - la la - la - la - la - la - la - la... This is so exciting, I have n't seen my monkey in almost a year. What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey - is - penis genre? C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey? I'm sorry guys, closed set. Uh, I'm sorry, you do n't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together. Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper. Ross, there he is. Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight. a-weema - way, a-weema - way..... \n","Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh... Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante. Woah, dude, burn. I do n't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday. Hey do n't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all. Now just how big of a star is Marcel? In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard. Woah. So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid. Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set? Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he? The one in the director's chair. Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me. OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you? Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'? We've got a problem. Tell me. I ca n't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche. Is it bad? It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean - Claude Van Damme is gon na be making out with Gabe Kaplan. I'll talk to her. I hate actors. Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost did n't see ya. Excuse me. Ahhhh. Uh, is your name Chandler? Uh, yes, yes it is. Chandler Bing? Do you know me or are you just really good at this game? I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse. Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look... great job growing up. It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it. Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I was n't a pimp. Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I do n't do that anymore. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. What what what what? Jean - Claude Van Damme. I did n't know he was in this movie, he is so hot. Ya think? The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop? No, was he any good in it? Rachel, he like, totally changed time. Wow, so why do n't you go talk to him? Oh, yeah. What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen? He could hear me. OK, I'm doin' it for ya. Oh Rachel do n't, do n't you dare, do n't, do n't. Tell him I cook. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Um, this is gon na sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute. You do n't think I'm cute? I, I do n't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her? You can tell her I think her friend is cute. No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows. OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money. Oh that's me, I got ta go. Oh uh, o, OK. Um, so listen, how many times am I gon na have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date. Well, uh, let's try one more... there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock. I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear. No one was around to hear that? So what'd he say? Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no. Well, thanks anyway. He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking. Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do... Jean - Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you. And then Jean - Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore. Oh man, Drew Barrymore's so smokin, Drew Barrymore has got the greatest set of... no guys around, huh. Does anybody need anything? Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. That is so unfair. I know. Oh, like you would drink Monica Geller coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme. Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. Trainer's gon na let me have him for a couple of hours. You're blowin' me off for a monkey? Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday. Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons. Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done. Stick a fork what? Like, when you're cooking a steak. Oh, OK, I do n't eat meat. Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done? Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell. OK, then, eat me, I'm done. I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on Susie couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly Susie turns to me and says,' Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?' What did you say? Ahh, I believe my exact words were,' Flaign, en - sten'. I mean I did n't know what to say, how do you know if you wan na do it on an elevator? Oh, you just know. Oh, shoot, we got ta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes. Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned should n't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops. Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We got ta go. But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear? Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there. Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner. You want me to wear your panties? Could ya? Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?... You're swell. OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake. Oooh. With mealworms. Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gon na happen here tonight? Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove -. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's got ta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye. OK, Rachel, why do n't you start talking first. Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but -. Do you think I ca n't see you in the TV set? Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share... Ya know, you had no right to go out with Van Damme. That is the most ridiculous. You sold me out. I did not sell you out. Yes you did. Absolutely. Would you let me talk. Did you just flick me? OK, well, you would n't let me finish and I was jus - Ow. That hurt Quit flicking Ow, you stop flicking. You flicked me first. OK, now I'm gon na kick some ass. Ow. Ow. Ow. Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing Van Damme, is that what you want? Uh-huh. You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing Van Damme instead? That's what you want? OK. Oh that's what you want. Yes. Fine. Fine, There we go. You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys. Forget about it. How you doin there squirmy? I'm hangin in... and a little out. So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities. I have nothing to do with casting. So what're you guys gon na eat? How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over? Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it. I want you right here, right now. Right now, right here. Do n't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa They do have the shrimp. Meet me in the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom now. C'mon. I ca n't believe we're doing this. Alright mister, let's see those panties. Alrighty. Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier? What? If you did n't have your shirt tucked into them. Oh. Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off. OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gon na miss hearing about the specials. C'mon hurry, hurry.

How could you still be upset about that? Well um, why do n't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back. I ca n't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean - Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy? Sure. This is so wild. Ya know, I got ta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date. Normally, I would not do it. Well, what made you make the exception for me?' Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and... Say you're sorry. No. Say it. No. Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it. OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater. Say you're sorry. OK, you wan na play? OK, let's play, let's play. What're you gon na do? You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara. You do n't have the guts. Oh yeah. Well, at least I was n't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute. Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place? Yes that's right. But still, I -, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves. I'll help you fix your sweater. I'll help you throw out your purse. I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing Van Damme. Well, I'm sorry I went out with Van Damme when I knew you liked him. I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves Joey? Ma? Joey! Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off. Oh, no no no, Susie took off with my clothes. Are you naked in there? Not exactly... I'm wearin panties. Huh, you uh, you always wear panties? No, no, this is the first time. Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes. I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them. Well, let me see. No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever. Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing. Joey, some people do n't like that. Chandler's wearing panties. What? Let me see. No, no, you do n't have to see. Hi Tushie. Alright, one of you give me your underpants.

Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants. Hi. Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you? I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on. Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie. What happened? One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye. Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right. Oh my God. What? I'm sorry it did n't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed. OK, well, bye. Goodbye. Well, bye for me too. OK, well, bye - bye again. OK. Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could... Oh, no no no no no. Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt. No no no no. Impressive. But no. Maybe if I were baking. Bye - bye. Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy. You know, I think I want to write a song about all this. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G - string? How long you been waitin' to say that? About 20 minutes.

Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet. I so am. You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life? Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track. Well, this all looks good. Great. And if I want to call for a reference on your last job? Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing. Alright, let s see if you're as good in person as you are on paper.

Wha, OK, now how do you know that? Because Rachel Green's your lobster. Oh, Phoebe Buffay's goin' somewhere. C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like... Hey, you feelin' better?

Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear. Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see. Well, I ca n't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii. What, what incident? Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Do n't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. Do you want a refill? No, I'm alright, thanks. OK. Ooh, OK, you got ta give me a second, I wan na get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now. I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's. I'm Gail. Chandler. I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you. What? Oh this is excellent. You know he could a gotten me a VCR, Joey Tribbiani could a gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap. It's not that bad. Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you do n't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. Chandler, Chandler. I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that... Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good. Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has Man been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha. I think she's OK.

We're, let's talk, what about us? Ross, there is no us, OK. No, but... No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it. Well, but, but... NO but Ross. We are never gon na happen, OK. Accept that. E-except, except that what? No, no, ACC - cept that. Oh. Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad. If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so. Well, does n't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me? Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we would n't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my... wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. You know what the... I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now... You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there. Hey guys. Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you did n't bring Ben? No, Ben's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.

So she dips into Monica Geller savings, that's what it's there for. Monica Geller's gon na be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. Anything larger back there? I ca n't believe it. Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay. Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. Hey. I've got something that's gon na make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two. What am I gon na do, huh? Hey. Hey. How come you have two? Well this one's for you. Get out. No, I ca n't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. That's what they'll call us. Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like. You have dinosaur checks?

Jack, would you let it go? Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster. Guys. Seriously, it is not like that. Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou... Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence. What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let Richard touch the Porsche. OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily? Well I... I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh. Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me. Here we go. Uh-huh. You're not going? Uh-huh. What? Is it - is this'cause of what Ross said? No. Well, yeah, maybe. I do n't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gon na work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922? What's 1922? Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo? Yes I do, it's just that Ross is... OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you? No. OK, who is the boss of you?!! You? No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!! How ya doin'? I'm a twinkie. Really? I'm a hero. Oh, this is so hard. Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them. Maybe we should just tell your parents first. My parents are dead. God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean... you know what I mean. I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright. Alright. Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you. Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support. Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob does n't believe I have one. I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city? I know. Richard's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon. I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo. Apparently, Richard told Johnny Shapiro that Monica Geller's quite a girl. In fact, Richard told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with Monica Geller. Really. I tell you, I've never seen him this happy. So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model? Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25 - year - olds. Oh Jack stop. C'mon, it's my birthday. Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment. Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it. Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love. Well it would n't kill you to say it once in a while. Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it. What? I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I do n't need a roommate anymore. Woah, woah, woah. I do n't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie. Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. Well that's how I feel. Well then maybe you should take it. Well then maybe I will. Fine with me. Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons. Who's drink can I freshen? Almost time for cake. Mon, Mon, are you OK? You remember that video I found of mom and dad? Yeah. Well, I just caught the live show. Eww. Hey there. What? Nothing, I just heard something nice about you. Humm, really? Richard. Richard. Your son is n't seeing anyone is Richard's son? Uhh, not that I know of. Well, I was thinking, why does n't Richard's son give Monica a call? That - that's an idea. Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone. Oh? Oh? Ohh. Monica Geller never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone? Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them are n't. Is that crystal? So, who's the mystery man? Well, uh, Richard's a doctor. A real doctor? No, a doctor of meat. Of course Richard's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and Richard's sweet, and know you'd like Richard. Well that's wonderful... I Mom, it's OK. It is Judy. Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW! Found it. I'll take that dad. It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item. That's impossible, Richard's got a twinkie in the city. Dad, I'm the twinkie. You're the twinkie? She's not a twinkie. Al - alright, l - look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in... Oh please, a relationship. Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man. Really? Yes. Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday? Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier. When did I say that? Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom. Oh that looks so good, oh I love it. I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lem me se yours. Ahh. OK, let's see yours again. Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours. Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I do n't know how - where it went. You did n't get it? No. Why did n't you get it?

I know, I know, and I was gon na get it but then Man 1 came in with this needle and uh, di -, did you know they do this with needles? Really? You do n't say, because mine was licked on by kittens. Hey. Hey. Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened... Yeah me too. I know. Yeah. Yeah. So do we need to hug here or... No, we're alright. So I got ya something. Plastic spoons. Great. Lick away my man. These'll go great in my new place. You know,' till I get real ones. What? Well, I ca n't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment. No - no, I mean what, what's this about your new place? I'm movin' out like we talked about. Well I did n't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight. Well, it was a fight... based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or... whatever. Well, there you go. Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I do n't want to leave you high and dry. Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine.

I do n't think that's gon na affect the plot of the show. How can they do this to me? Er, uh, I'm just gon na go. Sorry. Well it was n't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage. Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious. G'night. Night Richard. Good luck Mon. Alright, before I tell you, uh, why do n't you tell me how many women you've been with. Two. Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you? Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. Barbara was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two. Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gon na go brush my teeth. Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I do n't need the actual number, just a ballpark. Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark. Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now. Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number? Uhhhooo. C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them. Well, there's you. Better not be doin' these in order. Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo. Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini. Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him. Really? Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. Eddie, I did n't sleep with your ex-girlfriend. That's very interesting, ya know,'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with Eddie's ex-girlfriend would say. This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story. Where's Buddy? Buddy? My fish, Buddy. There was no fish when Eddie's ex-girlfriend dropped it off. Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy? Hey I did n't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That ca n't be smart. So we're just gon na take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me? Well yeah. Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet. You really ok with it? Oh honey, I'm fine. Oh, yay. Ok about that two. What? Alright, what about my two? Well, it just seems like a really small number. Right, and... And, well, do n't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat? Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I do n't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with. But you've only slept with two people. Right. Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right. Now I do. Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh. Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why do n't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock - knock jokes. God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was... Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex? Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gon na lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo. Knock - knock. But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had. Until now. Oh, hi. Hi. Richard just told me he loves me. Oh my God, honey that's great. I know. I just ca n't find... Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry. You need one too? Ooooh yeah. There's only one. Monica. Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. Rachel. Hey. Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting. Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different? No. Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat? I have a little comb. Oh. And what do you call that? A moustache comb. Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month. No. Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months. Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan. Agghhh. So were you in Nam? Rock - paper - scissors? Yeah. One two three. Yeesss. Fine, go have sex. No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, could n't feel his legs. No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was... Honey. What, what oh.... Shall we? It's not gon na happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow. Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand... So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. Why? Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. Why would you kill his fish? Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? Yeah. Wait, he's not here yet. So, he's on the show, he knows what happens. Yeah. Alright. Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way. Oh good. Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother. Oh Drake. Hard day huh? First the medical award, this. Some guys are just lucky I guess. Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat. Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong? No, no, they only said you. Oh, ok. Alright. I love you Drake. Yeah, whatever. Oh no. Drake, look out. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Did they just kill off Joey? No. Now maybe. C'mon. Joey. Open up. We want to talk to you. I do n't feel like talkin. Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you. We're worried about you. And some of us really have to pee. Sorry Joey Hey. Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks. We came over as soon as we saw. How could you not tell us? I do n't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out. Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back. Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin. But Joey, you're gon na be fine. You do n't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera. Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say. Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you wo n't get mildew. What? To me that's nice. It's gon na be ok. You know that? No, I do n't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gon na be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre - approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life. I'm sorry man. Yeah, Joey honey, I do n't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us. No, that means nothin to me. Uhhhaahh. Pecan sandy, just made em. Yeah alright. What're these, raisins? Uh, sure, why not. Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling? I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie.

Hey. Ohh, brisk tonight. Oh man. Let's never speak of this. You got it. \n","Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here? Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep. Why? Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh - heh, please. I ca n't sleep now. You want me to sing? No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now. Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man. Hannibal Lecter... better roommate than you. No. See now I do n't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you do n't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh? I did n't realize that. Yeah. GET OUT NOW!! Ok, you really want me out? Yes please. Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out. I want you out. No no no, I wan na hear it from your lips. Where did you hear it from before? Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow. I heard that. Hey. Hey. Hey. Whe - ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh? Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at' em and I though, you know what I do n't have? A mirror? Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty. Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood. Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's got ta have some kind of cache. Cache? Jaunty? Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gon na get some coffee. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oooh, so so so, did you read the book? Oh my God, it was incredible. Did n't it like totally speak to you? Woah, woah, woah, what book is this? Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered. Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it. Men just take out wind? Ya - huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers. Wow. Yeah. Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit. It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard. Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind. No. No,'cause he's yummy. Yes. But all the other ones. Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip. Anybody want a croan. Ok, this is a typical lightning - bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um,' Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?' Do n't worry about it already. Things happen. So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything? Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth? No, can we get back to me? Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World. Alright. Cab driver number two? You're welcome. But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab? Things change, roll with em. But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gon na do this. Joey, I'm gon na tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and do n't make on the floor. I'm sorry. See ya. Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so. Is n't it. Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called' Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'. I do n't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you. Hey you guys. Hey. Uh, sweetie we've got ta go. NO! No? No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you do n't miss the beginning. No, see this is n't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. You go girl. I ca n't pull that off can I? Excuse me, your, your, your wind? Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you wo n't let me blow? You, you know I, I do n't, have a - have a problem with that. Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry. Um - um, um - um. You're right, I do n't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit! What is it? I, I do n't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I do n't really get it but she's, Ross' date's pretty upset about it. See, this is why I do n't date women who read. Uh-oh. What, what's that? It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That ca n't be good. Open it, open in. Oh my God. Woah. Look at this, how did I spend so much money? Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due. Ahh. What, woah, woah, $ 3500 at porcelain safari? My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, Man 1 spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I do n't know what I'm gon na do. Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World. What? That audition. That's a two line part. Joey, you owe $ 1100 at I Love Lucite. So what. So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money. Hey, look, I do n't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic. Toilet paper? Yeah. Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic. Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. I am your friend. Well then tell me things like,' Joey you'll be fine,' and,' Hang in there,' and, and,' Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.' But I do n't know it. What I do know is that you owe $ 2300 at Is n't it Chromantic. Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe. Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gon na be till you get another. Look, I do n't wan na hear this right now. Huh, I'm just saying... Well do n't just say. Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go. Ok. Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok. I do n't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gon na happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there? Hey pal. Ahhhh - gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here? Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic! Look Eddie, are n't you forgetting anything? Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one. Maybe'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, is n't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now? Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac! Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time... Ah - ah - ah, you know what that is? Your last roommate's kidney? That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display. Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go. Lemonade? You ok man? Ah, it's career stuff. I do n't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show. Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it? I fell down an elevator shaft. That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche. What? I used to be Bryce on All My Children. Daaahhhh! Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh! Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching. I wa - Uuuh. Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons. Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. What? You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT! You, you want, you want me to move out? Uh-huh. I uh, I got ta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean do n't you think? This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue. Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack! You want some help. No help required Chico. All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gon na cost you about so bucks. Excuse me, that's 50 bucks. What? Five oh dollars. Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. That's great. And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims'cause I have a background in medical acting. Ok, listen, thanks for coming in. No no, uh, do n't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there were n't ya. I'll have a good day. Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no. And I would have to say pah - huh. What? Do you not remember the puppet guy? Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power. And his puppet too. Yeah ok, well at least I did n't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date. Who? Paul. Oh. Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30. Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29. Not uh, not to my recollection.

I do n't know. C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh. I do n't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we do n't know Richard really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old - er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings. So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag.

Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg. Think I better go before mommy starts weeping. Buy mommy. We love you. Buy. Have a good time. Ok, Ben. Ross. Yeah. Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here? How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula. You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard. Not like him, per-se, just not un-like Richard. Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler. Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. So Joey, why did n't you grow a moustache? Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, Chandler Bing got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. Hey listen, we've got ta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs. You're meeting Richard? Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game. Yeah, did n't he tell ya? Well, Richard told me he was going out with the guys, I just did n't know that you were the guys. You hear that? We're the guys. We're the guys. With that moustache does n't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia? Thank you. Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da - da. Da - da. Can you say da - da? Look, I'm gon na tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. No luck huh? Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah - condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold Ben for a sec,'cause I, I got ta take this off. Oh, yeah sure, Ok. What're you doing? Uh, I'm holding Ben. Yeah, well, Ben's a baby not a bomb. Ok. Well just hold Ben like you'd hold a football. This is how I would hold a football. Ok, here, here. There we go. Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I have n't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one. It's alright, it's no big deal. Really? Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. What? What? You think about stuff like that? Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. Two, two babies? Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here wo n't feel too competitive. Then what's gon na happen? Well, we wo n't wan na raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale. Uh-huh. Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we do n't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what. Huh? I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gon na go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I do n't have a pot. I do n't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? Hey. Hey Phoebs, what's happening? Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes. So you watched the movies huh? Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no,'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies. Charlotte who? With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud. Alright, you wan na feel better? Yeah. Ok, here, watch this. It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this. So you ca n't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in. Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gon na see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease. Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Did n't you kinda see it coming? Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. Hey, big guy, game time. Hey, be right there. There's a game? Uh, yeah, I just got my pick - up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel. It's the basketball playoffs. Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you do n't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other. Oh, no, honey, I mean, do n't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they do n't start sentences with,' You know who just died shoveling snow?' Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks. Uh, it's the college playoffs. Oh, then go Vassar. Uh, they're not in it. Ok, then just go. Ok. Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I do n't wan na be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wan na spend 24 hours a day with them. Sure. It's just that he does n't have that much free time, ya know, and I do n't know, what do I do? Does it matter? You're ultimately just gon na die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off. Aghh. Me too. I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys. Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century. Ya know what, I think I'm gon na go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles. Ok, what the hell happened back there? I do n't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes. Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. C'mon, what, you never think about our future? Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gon na sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gon na have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gon na be. You know what our childrens names are gon na be. No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good. What was the book? The big book of childrens' names. Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. Yeah. But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gon na have to deal with that. Ok fine. Thank you. We're not done. I did n't know that. Ok, then you're gon na have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gon na stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gon na end up together and if that scares you, tough,'cause you're gon na have to deal with that. Fine, I will. Good,'cause I love you. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well I love you too. Well that's the first time we've said that. Yes it is. Well, I'm gon na kiss you. Well you better. Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip. Did you like it? Oh yeah. You know, I do n't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but do n't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? I did n't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \" It's a sucky life and just when you think it ca n't suck any more it does. \" Kick save and... denied. But... Richard gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier? Man you are incredible. Well, we had a table in college. Oh really, I did n't know they had foosball in the 1800's. Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gon na kick in. Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table. Ok, just one more point. Score! Now can we go? See, that's why we do n't let her play. Is everything all right? Um - hmm. Uh-oh. Oh hey listen, do n't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time. Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with. Well. No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just - ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here. Uh, you guys see me as a dad? Oh yeah. No. Nooooo. Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal. Uh-huh, yeah. No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work. That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gon na go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around. Nighty - nite. You're not a dad. You're not a dad. Not a dad. I ca n't believe you got us into trouble. So are you ok? Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys. Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball. What're you talkin' about, I was killin'' em. Yeah, well they suck too. Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail. Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper does n't make this process any cuter. Hello. It's us. Come on up. I'm gon na get the rest of his stuff together. Ok, we can do this now, ca n't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said' Hi'. Wha, what? Ben just said hi. What, the word hi? Ye -, no, my Uncle Hi. Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything. Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him. Hello. Guess what. Ben just said his first word. What did he say? Something about hi. That's so exciting. Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi. You know, actually it's more like, hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Ok, this could go on for a while. We've got a cab waiting downstairs. Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him. Tuesday. Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys. Take care. Bye Ben. Bye. Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me. Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college. We've got ta go, we've got that cab waiting. Alright, alright, ok. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, is n't this a nice hole here. Hey. Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and ca n't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. \n","Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?' Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting. Ok honey, you really need a job. Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview. Really. Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there. On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh. No,'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet... which is my father's last name. Ahh. And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. His indian name? No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I do n't think so. Freakish. Wow. Freaky. Weird, weird. Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger? Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him. Why? Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist. Man, I am so beat. Oh yeah. Hey, you just wan na forget about raquetball and hang out here? Yeah alright. Hey you're in our seats. Oh, sorry we did n't know. Hey, we were sitting there. Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it? Is that supposed to be funny? No actually, I was just going for colorful. What's with this guy? What's with you? Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee. What just happened? I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat. That, that is funny. Can I have it back? No. No? No. Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat. Why should we? Because it's a special hat. See he bought it'cause Chandler Bing was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler... Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat? You got a problem with that? No, just wan na make sure we're on the same page. Hey, how'd the interview go? It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries? So do n't do it. How can I not do it? I have $ 127 in the bank. Monica, relax, go get a beer. I do n't want a beer. Who said it was for you? Hhhiiii. What's the matter with you? The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat. Noo. You're kiddin'. It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff is n't supposed to happen anymore. Oohhh. Hi. Hi. Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one. Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back. Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now. Hey, I went up. What? My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $ 127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have... a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gon na do it. Do what? Put all my money in me. Monica, what are you talking about? You do n't know the first thing about the stock market. What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan... yeah telephone number of the stock... selling store. See, did n't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea? Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gon na say' Hi birthfather'. We love you, we're here for you. Yeah good luck, good luck. Thanks. Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich? Ohh, what is in that? Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo. No no,'cause mayo, that would make it gross. Hey, hey, no, oh oh. Run Phoebe run. No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wan na love all animals, please no. Get him a bone, get a bone. You got ta bone? Are you kidding me? Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem. Well why do n't you just reach out and take his trampoline. Ok, here, I know what we can do. Hey, hey, hey no. Ok, doggie get the - aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the... ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say? Well if he's not gon na eat it, I will. Are you crazy? Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh. Hey. What? Do you have to be a Century 21 real - estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets? Do you say this stuff to girls? Hehehehey, is n't that the guy who used to wear your hat? And look where they're sitting. You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door. Maybe we did n't make it clear enough. Yeah. This couch belongs to us. Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to. You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here. Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat. Fellas, these guys were here first. Oh, sorry, I did n't realize. Sorry. There you go. Thank you Gunther. We did n't want to have to go and do that. Ross Geller told on us? You told on us? Well pal, you did n't give me much of a choice. Do n't play with his things. I know. Alright, let's take this outside. Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that? The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that. You had to ask. Yeah. Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gon na fight you guys. Well then here's the deal, you wo n't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again. I think you played the Gunther card too soon. Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go. Yeah, I do n't know. What's the matter? I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gon na be around forever, despite what Phoebe's grandmother says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I do n't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right. Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand. Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wan na go home? Ok, thanks. Sorry, again What was that? Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now. I wan na buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wan na buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo. Time is money my friend? Yeah, you missed,' Takes money to make money,' and uh,' Do n't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.' Hey, I made $ 17 before breakfast, what have you done? Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $ 3.50. How did you make $ 17. Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY. How come those? Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy. What happened to uh, MEG.? MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down. That is so not my motto. Hey. Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog? Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, Guy 1 said that the little fella's gon na be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow. Good. Oh, thank God. Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and Guy 1 said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so... still hoping. Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gon na call your dad and let Frank Buffay know that his dog is ok? I, I do n't wan na meet my father over the phone. What am I gon na say, like' Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.' Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it. Ok. Listen, just do n't say anything about me, ok. DO N'T... be too long with the phone. Phoebe Buffay'll be a much better friend when the market closes. It's a woman. So talk to Miss Buffay. Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. Why the voice. Hard to say. Your cappucino sir. Thank you. Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house. Absolutely. How come it's not mixing with the water? Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there. Ok. No. No? No. Man I do n't wan na have to have Joey with me every time I wan na descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I do n't wan na spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a' K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. Alright, hang on a second there Custer. Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? Yeah, sure. By someone besides Monica? No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'. Well, could n't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. What? Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. For what? I've got ta get back in the game. Why, when did you get out of the game? I do n't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it. Oh no. Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too. Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks? I, I do n't have it. But I need it. Otherwords I'm gon na have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I do n't wan na have to wear flame retardant boobs. Nobody does honey. Hi. Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog? It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. Phoebe Buffay's a vegetarian. What are these, stitches? Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you ca n't let him look up too long'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast. Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him. Sure, oh, is, is Frank home. How do you know Frank? Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here? Yeah. Frank. Yeah. What? Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior. Frank Buffay went out for groceries. Ok so will he be back soon? Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now. Alright, I'm, I'm gon na go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry. Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad? Um well I do n't really. Just genetically. Frank Buffay's kinda my dad too. Heavy. Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe? No but he did n't really talk about anything. Oh. Except stilts. Stilts? Yeah, Frank Buffay loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and Frank Buffay was waving'cause Frank Buffay was always happiest when Frank Buffay was on his stilts. Wow. Yeah. I do n't know what to do with that. Me neither. So you're like my big sister. Yeah. This is huge, you can buy me beer. I'm not gon na. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say,' Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.' I got ta friend named Mark. That'll work too. Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'. Yeah, that'd be ok. Alright. Ok, I'm in the book. Ok, yeah. Alright. So um, stilts huh? Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter. Ok. Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take? Would you come on! Come on! Thank you. Ah, there we go. I think we proved our point. You burn your mouth? Can not feel my tounge. Bullies, big bullies. Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies. Did we not make ourselves clear the other day. Yes, and that's why we're here. Yes, we're standing out ground... apparently. Let's do this alright. Woah, ho - ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon? It's a nice watch, I do n't wan na break it on your ribs. Alright, let's do this. Alright. Question. If I do n't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon? Whad'ya mean? Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it. No, you ca n't use your watch. Ok. Or your keys. Ok. Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this. Before I forget, are we hitting faces? Of course we're hitting faces, why would n't you hit faces? Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation. Actually, you know, uh, I got ta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea. Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating. Oh really, you guys tryin' again? Yeah. Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle? C'MON! Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh?

Look at her. Hi Monica. He - he - he, how's it goin'? Hey nice boobs. Guys guys, check this out. Excellent. \n","So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon. Ohhh. What? Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things? You wan na be in charge of the food committee? Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees? Really. Why ca n't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are. Alright. If you guys do n't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want. Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk. Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come. Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper. Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper. Why not Shannon Cooper? Cause Shannon Cooper uh, Shannon Cooper steals stuff. Or maybe Shannon Cooper does n't steal stuff and Joey just slept with Shannon Cooper and never called her back. Joey that is horriable. Hey I liked Shannon Cooper, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I do n't know I guess I just got scared. I'm sorry, I did n't know. I did n't think anyone'd buy that, ok. Hi honey, how did it go? Agh, it was the graduation from hell. Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica. So what happened? My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. Ok, so I guess we do n't invite Rachel Green parents. Well, how bout just her mom? Why her mom? Cause I already invited her. Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth? Oh no, ca n't invite her. She also steals. Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake? Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. Excuse me? It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert. Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo. Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here? What? The father ca n't drop by to see the daughter on Rachel Green birthday? No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that Rachel Green's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye - bye. Ohhh, you're having a parteee. No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey. I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it? This is n't your first surprise party, is it sir? Hi Monica. Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus. So, basically just a Chinese guy. Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why do n't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed. Alright, that sounds like a two person job. Well, my goodness, what was that? Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just were n't ready for you yet. You thought I was Rachel? Yes because uh, you look so young. And because you're both, you know, white women. Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom? NO! No, I'll take that for ya. Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you.

I ca n't believe this is happening. You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put' em all together and if they ca n't deal with it, who cares. I do. That's who. Look, are you gon na be ok? Well, I have to be, I do n't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes. Well, actually just one birthday flan. What? It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert... Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee. Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said,' I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party. Quick volleyball question. Volleyball. Yeah, we set up a court in your room.

Uhh, let's just stay clear of' I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok. Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out. Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery.... game? It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today. I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead. Listen you guys, I do n't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wan na push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going? I um, was sorta thinking about maybe... No. No you ca n't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker. Listen if you wan na go, just go. No, she'll yell at me again. Alright, I can get you out. What? Shh. In a minute, I'm gon na create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and do n't look back. I think I need a drink. Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want? Scotch. Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass. Neat. Cool. No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks. I know. Oh hello Ross, where have you been? Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse. Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink. Oh, mine too. Is n't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister? I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket. No. no. Whad'ya mean no? No, um, see'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir. Get my glasses too. All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time. Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is,' Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny. Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster? What? I do n't see anything. Great, I'm seeing water rings again. Ross, whose glasses are those? Mine. You wear bi-focals? Um - hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals. Did you know my husband has glasses just like that? Well those are very popular frames. Neil Sedaka wears them. I hear you can get people out of here. Rachel, you did n't tell me your boyfriend smoked. Yeah, like a chimney. Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gon na go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. Are you wearing my glasses? Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you. Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes? Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip. Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute. What about my friend Victor? No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious. Alright, let me just get my coat. There is n't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door. Is it true they have beer? Everything you've heard is true. Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament. You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here? Um Ok, welcome to the fu - oh. Phoebe. Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go. Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... You want me to see a therapist? Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father. Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I got ta go, I got ta go do a thing. Did you know your mother spent $ 1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place. Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wan na hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff. You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat. You work and you work and you work on a boat... He always ridiculed my pottery classs...... and you sand it and you varnish it...... but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.... and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...... the scotch and the cigarettes...... and the bansai's and the chiuaua...... I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...... what the hell does she want with half a boat... Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor. This is it, is n't it? I mean, this is what my life is gon na be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. Mrs. Greene gets the house, Mr. Greene's in some condo my sister's gon na decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this? Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July. Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made Mrs. Greene hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just... I, I know. Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun. Alright, Monica dear, I'm gon na hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem. Ok will do. So glad you came. I think I saw Rachel out in the hall. Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye. Oh ok. Happy birthday sweetie. Ok. Ahh, you drive safe. Ross, what're you doing. I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing? Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going? To get my coat. No no no. Alright, alright, I can get my own coat. Sorry, we're on a major flan high. Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe. I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you. Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway. Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care. Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years. Thank you. Ok everybody, it's time for flan. Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun. Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection. Ok, that's enough. Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish. Ok, I've got one. Wow, those things almost never come true. \n","Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left. Oh, I ordered mine first. Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster... Give it to me. No. Give it to me. Ok, you can have it. There you go, enjoy your coffee. That was there when I got here. Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York. Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow. Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy. You went out with a guy in the Navy? Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy'cause he did n't have any change. Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? No. No, Ryan is my submaring guy. Ryan resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay. So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time? That'll teach you to lick my muffin. Hiii. Oh no, what happened? Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox. Oh no. Yeah, so if you have n't already had it, chances are you're gon na get it. Well I've had it. Yeah, I've had it. Had it. Had it. Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look! Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you do n't have to do that. This is n't camp. Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown. Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town? Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown. What're you doing? Just waiting for you sweetie. Are you remaking the bed? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine. Then, you're redoing it because... If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy. You're pretty much running that risk either way. Ok, you see, the tag should n't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner. Oh, well that's not so crazy. I'm just easing you in. Oh, alright. Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You do n't love me any more do you. Actually, if it's possible, I love you more. Really? Wow, well then come on, I wan na show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor. But do n't you need experience for a job like that? It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections. Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor. No kidding. Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call. Where do you work? Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group. Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, do n't touch his sandwiches. Ha - ha - ha... Ha - ha. Are all you processors dorks? Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you. You look fabulous honey, you really do. Yeah? Are you sure, really. You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights. I, I, I'm hideous. It's gon na be ok. Ryan's been under water. Ryan's just gon na be so glad that you do n't have barnicles on your butt. Come in. Hey baby, I'm back... Hey Ryan, what's up? What's goin' on? Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox. Chicken or small? Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian. Why are n't you at home in bed?' Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have,'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are. I'm sorry, I never had' em. Ohh, ohh. If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub Jimmy Hauser all over my face. Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I did n't have them now. Can I please see your face? Nope. You do n't want to see a face covered with pox. Your face could be covered with lochs, I would n't care. And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary. Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely. I hate this.' Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this. Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gon na let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had. Hey. Hey, how's the first day goin'? Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. Well there you go. Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie. Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie? Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh? Weird world. Your kids? I figure my character has kids. Ya know there is n't a part of that sentence I do n't need explained. Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does. Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes. Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did. Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there. You know what makes the itching even worse? That you do n't stop talking about it. Fine. Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice... What're you doing? Are you scratching? No. This is what I do for luck, ok. You're scratching. Give me the dice. No. Give me the dice. No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes. We ca n't scratch. You know we ca n't, we'll scar. Uhh, I ca n't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wan na grab all these houses and rub' em all over my body. No. Give it. No. Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. Oh God help me. Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder. Oh, stop that, stop that right now. You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man. You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it. Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gon na have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better. Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie. Bye bye Joey. What a phony. Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas. Sir. Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gon na receive the systems report until next Friday? Well the people in my group wan na spend the holiday weekend with their families. I have a family, I'm gon na be here. Yeah Bing, what's that about? It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wan na see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday. Rough numbers? This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas. Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday. Uh, if you say so sir. Joseph's good, is n't Joey Tribbiani? Well, I'm going to kill you. Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. Why? Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', Joey Tribbiani'll call you on it.' What're you tryin' to pull,' Joey Tribbiani'll say. Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too? This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands. You're strict. It's for their own good. You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time. Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Do n't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular? If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle. Very good. Thank you. You know what. Tomorrow I'm gon na do your clocks. You're gon na do what to my clocks. I'm gon na set them to my time. Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time. No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wan na know why? Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen. No forget it, I'm not gon na tell you now. No come on. Come on tell me. No. See you do n't understand. Come on. No. You do n't have any of these cute little obsessive things. No that's not true. That is not true. Oh yeah. Yeah. Alright, well tell me one of yours. Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks. What if they get mixed up? Boy I would just uh, I would freak out. You would not. I ca n't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I ca n't believe my boyfriend does n't have a thing. My boyfriend does n't have a thing. See, if anyone overheard that, I did n't come off well. Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you. Why? Wh - wh - why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?' Cause Mr. Douglas has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. Wha - wh - why, why, why does Mr. Douglas suspect that? Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gon na have to let both of you go. What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. I do n't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think Joey Tribbiani's a brown - nosing suck up. Oh yeah. Well you ca n't fire Joseph. You know why,'cause Joey Tribbiani's not in your department. Alright, ok, alright. So I ca n't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife. Karen. Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did. Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer. Really? No freakshow, she's fictional. Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else. Thank you. It's just that, I, I'm gon na miss Joseph. I liked Joey Tribbiani. His wife, Karen was hot. Can I please take these off? I swear I wo n't scratch. No sorry hon, Monica's orders. Well that was n't easy. Ok, dinner's on. And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gon na be hot but that should n't be a problem for you. Alright you kids, bye now. Bye. Oh look, a low budget puppet show. It's such a shame you ca n't see which finger I'm holding up. Wine? Please. Oh, I spilled some. I got it. I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight. What? Sorry. You look beautiful. Oh. You know what, that's it, that's it. Monica, wake up. Monica. What's up? I thought of a thing. Yeah? Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed. No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed. Or so I would have you believe. No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed. Hey come on, you have n't heard my reason yet. Alright, go on. Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side. Oh my God, you're a freak. Yeah. How' bout that. So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to? I really ca n't say. So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board? I ca n't say. Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys. I'm sorry, but I ca n't say. Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines. I better get out of here, I'm gon na miss my flight. Ok, I'll walk you out. Bye Ryan. Pleasure. It was nice to meet you. Take care. So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things? You like that do ya? Oh yeah. I'll make some calls. Ok. Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together? I know. We did n't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. Taxi. Bye you. Oh I'm sorry, we're clo -... Hey sailor. Is this what you had in mind? I'll say. I'm shipping out tomorrow. Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light. Alright you know, why do n't I just meet you upstairs. \n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"NWgahJTUAcLX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622461305210,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":164651,"user":{"displayName":"Nera F","photoUrl":"","userId":"14705679023444594421"}},"outputId":"a033e4f2-b292-4d34-cb76-9eefeee4bdcb"},"source":["nlp = en_core_web_lg.load()\n","neuralcoref.add_to_pipe(nlp)\n","\n","for s in episodes:\n","  doc2 = nlp(s)\n","  print(s)\n","\n","  for ent in doc2.ents:\n","      print(ent._.coref_cluster)"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\u001b[1;30;43mStreaming output truncated to the last 5000 lines.\u001b[0m\n","None\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo, He, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, he, his, he, me]\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo, He, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, he, his, he, me]\n","Monica: [Monica, Monica]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo, He, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, he, his, he, me]\n","None\n","None\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo, He, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, he, his, he, me]\n","Rachel: [Rachel, him, him, He]\n","None\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo, He, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, he, his, he, me]\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo, He, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, Paolo, he, his, he, me]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Rachel: [Rachel, Rachel]\n","Rachel: [Rachel, Rachel]\n","None\n","None\n","Chandler: [Chandler, Chandler, Chandler, Chandler, goodbye Chandler, Chandler]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Ross: [Ross, Ross, Ross, she, her, Ross]\n","Monica: [Monica, Monica]\n","Chandler: [Chandler, Chandler, Chandler, Chandler, goodbye Chandler, Chandler]\n","None\n","Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?

Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio. So Paolo's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just got ta go to Rome. Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome. Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. So, uh, how's Ross' grandmother doing? The doctor says it's a matter of hours. How - how are you, Mom? Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here.... What's with your hair? What? What's different? Nothing. Oh, maybe that's it. Mrs. Geller is unbelievable, our mother is... Okay, relax, relax. We are gon na be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. Oh God! The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. Oh!... Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Ross' grandmother Sweet' n' Los. How Ross' grandmother was always stealing them from - from restaurants. Not just restaurants, from our house. Mrs. Geller? Ross' grandmother looks so small. I know. Well, at least she's with Pop - Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. G'bye, Nana. Bye, Nana. Ross! What is going on?! Y'know how - how the nurse said that - that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.. What? She's not - past, she's present, Ross' grandmother's back. What's going on? Ross' grandmother may have died. Ross' grandmother may have died? We're looking into it. I, uh, I'll go see. This almost never happens! Now Ross' grandmother's passed. I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair? Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. Yeah, you have homosexual hair. So, um, did she... Twice. Twice? Oh, that sucks! You guys okay? I du n no, it's weird. I mean, I know Ross' date's gone, but I just do n't feel, uh... Maybe that's'cause she's not really gone. Nono, Ross' date's gone. We checked. A lot. Hm, I mean maybe no - one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that Lily Buffay's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high - got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course - I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?... I miss her. Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? Thanks! Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. Now, see, I do n't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!... So Chandler looks gay, huh? Y'know, I du n no who this is, but it's not Debbie. I thought it was gon na be a closed casket. Well, that does n't mean she ca n't look nice! Sweetie, you think you can get in there? I do n't see why not. Here's my retainer! I was just thinking. When my time comes - Dad! Listen to me! When my time comes, I wan na be buried at sea. You what? I wan na be buried at sea, it looks like fun. Define fun. C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch...... And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun. Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says' Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say' Buried at sea! Huh!'. That's probably what they'll say. I'd like that. Hey, gorgeous. Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um - No, nono, do n't - do n't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake. Oh! Okay! Phew! So, uh... what do you think it is about me? I du n no, uh... you just have a-a...... Quality, right, great. Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple. Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with? What? Lowell's cute! Well, yeah...' s'no Brian in Payroll. Is Brian...? No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gon na set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like Brian. Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league. Excuse me? You do n't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.... I'm really not. This one? No. I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant - suit, go with the burgundy. You know, whatever we pick, Ross' grandmother would've told us it's the wrong one. You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. Wait! We need shoes! Okay. Um, how about these? That's really a day shoe. And where Ross' grandmother's going everyone else'll be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. No, it really should be burgundy. Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. Oh my God.. Is everything all right, dear? Yeah, just... just Nana stuff. How we doing, you guys ready? Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature? Some days it's all I can think about. Hi, sorry I'm late, I could n't find my bearings. Oh, you - you mean your earrings? What'd I say? Hm - m. Are these the shoes? Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy. What, we - uh - we do n't have shoes here, or...? Morning. We ready to go? Well, do n't we look nice all dressed up?... It's stuff like that, is n't it? It was a really beautiful service. It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream. What? Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger. Check it out, Giants - Cowboys. You're watching a football game at a funeral? No, it's the pre-game. I'm gon na watch it at the reception. You are a frightening, frightening man. Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! Oh, I hope they're not ruined. God, what a great day.... What? Weather - wise! I know, uh, the air, the - the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh - I du n no, almost life - aff - God! Ross! I'm fine. Just - just... having my worst fear realised... Okay, do n't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm... huh. What, what is it? You missed a belt loop. Oh! No - n - Okay, it's in spasm. Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. Oh, no - Sorry - Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter. Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. Hey, look who's up! How do you feel? I feel great. I feel - great, I fleel great. Wow, those pills really worked, huh? Not the first two, but the second two - woooo!... I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister, I love Pheebs... Ooh! That's so nice...... Chandler! Hey. And listen, man, if you wan na be gay, be gay. Does n't matter to me. You were right. Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most. Oh, well you know who I love the most? No. You! Oh.. you do n't get it! Whaddya got there? Just a, uh... hearing disability. What's the score? Seventeen - fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third. Beautiful! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Your grandmother would have hated this. Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. No, I'd be hearing about' Why did n't I get the honey - glazed ham?', I did n't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more Monica's grandmother'd be saying' Why are you wasting your money? I do n't need flowers, I'm dead'. That sounds like Nana. Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?... I can imagine. I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life - affirming person that Mrs. Geller is. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her? Tell her what? How Monica's grandmother drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told Monica's grandmother the truth?... No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. Huh. More wine, dear? Oh, I think so. Those earrings look really lovely on you. Thank you. They're yours. Actually they were Nana's. Now I'm depressed!... Even more than I was. Hey, who's this little naked guy? That little naked guy would be me. Aww, look at the little thing. Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown - ups now? Who are those people? Got me. Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.' Me and the gang at Java Joe's'. Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there? Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25? Looks like a fun gang. Ooh, look - look - look - look - look! I got Monica naked! Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something. Hey, Lowell. Hey, Chandler. So how's it going there in Financial Services? It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How' bout you? Good, good. Listen, heh, I du n no what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not. I know. That's what I told her. Really. Yeah. So - you can tell? Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar. So you do n't think I have a, a quality? Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is. He is? Yup, and waaay out of your league. Out of my league. I could get a Brian. If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.

but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $ 100 advance in my salary? An advance? It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job. Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that. Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips? Huh? Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $ 98.50 to go. Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? No, they're not. Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. You're wrong. I am not wrong. You're wrong. No, I just talked to them. I'm calling Mom. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. And this from the cry - for - help department. Are you wearing makeup? Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model. That's so funny,'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman. What were you modeling for? You know those posters for the city free clinic? Oh, wow, so you're gon na be one of those \" healthy, healthy, healthy guys \"? You know, the asthma guy was really cute. Do you know which one you're gon na be? No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... Good luck, man. I hope you get it. Thanks. Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right? Yeah. And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. Yes, every single one of them. Phoebe, you're gon na be with your grandma? Yes, and Phoebe's grandmother boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December'cause Phoebe's grandmother's boyfriend is lunar. So you're free Thursday, then. Yeah. Oh, can I come? Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gon na make it to Vail? Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go. I thought it was $ 98.50. Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. Well, I'm off to Carol's. Ooh, ooh! Why do n't we invite Carol Willick? Ooh, ooh. Because Carol Willick's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring Carol Willick, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. Hi, is uh, is Carol here? No, Carol Willick's at a faculty meeting. Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan : Come in. Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. What's it look like? Kinda like a big face without skin. Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they do n't let you do it. Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. The uh, the baby that has n't been born yet? Would n't that mean you're... crazy? What, you do n't think they can hear sounds in there? You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Do you uh, do you talk about me? Yeah, yeah, all the time. Really? But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this. Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head. Hey, Rach, did you make your money? No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop. Rach, here's your mail. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. No, here's your mail. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. Would you just open it? Oh my god, oh, you guys are great. We all chipped in. We did? You owe me 20 bucks. Thank you. Thank you so much! Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? All right, I'm nine years old. Oh, I hate this story. We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have -- and I remember this part vividly -- a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. Oh my god. Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together. We did? Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis? Yeah, right. I got ta tell you. You're the best in the business. Get out. I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back. Really? You do n't know what that means to me. Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing? Nothing. Listen, uh, you wan na go get a drink or something? Yeah. Oh. What's wrong? I just remembered, I have to do something. Oh. What? Um, leave. Wait, wait, wait! So I guess you all saw it. Saw what? No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious. Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD. Tonight, on a very special Blossom. Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What? I do n't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. That's closer. I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop. Oh, you must stop shooping. Ok, I'm gon na get my stuff. Chandler, will you just come in already? No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. Look out, incoming pumpkin pie! Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. Hey, Monica, I got a question. I do n't see any tater tots. That's not a question. But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I ca n't be with my family because of my disease. All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. Ah! Ok, Mom never hit. Ok, all done. What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps! Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. Why would we do that? Well,'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. Ok, good - bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. The balloon? No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, Underdog broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me? I ca n't, I got ta go. Come on. An 80 - foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen? Almost never. Got the keys? or Got the keys! Ok. Anytime you're ready. Ok, ok, here we go. Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but... Just aim for the bump. Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, ca n't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid. So do n't do it, it's fine. You do n't have to do it just because Susan does it. Hello, baby. Hello, hello. I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park. Yeah, but did they have to shoot him down? I mean, that was just mean. Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here? We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys. No I do n't. Yes, you do. When we left, you said, \" got the keys. \" No I did n't. I asked, \" got the ke - eys? \" No, no, no, you said, \" got the keys \". Do either of you have the keys? The oven is on. Oh, I got ta get my ticket! Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key. Well then get it, get it! That tone will not make me go any faster. Joey! That one will. And everyone's telling me, you got ta pick a major, you got ta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you do n't have gills anymore. Look, you do n't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want. Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok? Hi, how's it goin? Shh! Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey! Hey, uh, did you just feel that? I did. Does it always, uh --? No, no that was the first. Keep singing! Keep singing! Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I ca n't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo. I felt it! Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts. Nope, not that one. Can you go any faster with that? Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math. Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway? For an emergency just like this. All right, listen, smirky. If it was n't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this right now. But I'm not. I swear you said you had the keys. No, I did n't. I would n't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously did n't have the keys. Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys. Why would I have the keys? Aside from the fact that you said you had them? But I did n't. Well, you should have. Why? Because! Why? Because! Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Is n't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no! Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all burned, and, and I... I... Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go. Well, the turkey's burnt. Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined. Here we come, walkin' down thethis does n't smell like Mom's. No, it does n't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross? Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one. Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys. Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice. Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner? You call that delicious? Stop it, stop it, stop it! Now this feels like Thanksgiving. Ooh. What? Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal. I've got ta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy! Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing! It's nice that he has someone. Shall I carve? By all means. Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese? I do n't even wan na know about the dark cheese. Does anybody wan na split this with me? Oh, I will. Ooh, you guys have to make a wish. Make a wish? Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for? The bigger half. I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this is n't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it did n't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you did n't have syphilis and stuff, we would n't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked. That's so sweet. And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas. And a crappy New Year. Here, here!

There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. Oooh! W - wait. What is that?' That' would be Marcel. You wan na say hi? No, no, I do n't. Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab. That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel? Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass! Ross, is he gon na live with you, like, in your apartment? Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so... Why do n't you just get a roommate? Nah, I du n no... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe -.... sorry, that's, that's' pathet', which is Sanskrit for' really cool way to live'. So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide, and one about a snowman. Might wan na open with the snowman. Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy. So, how'd it go? Ahhhhhh, I did n't get the job. How could you not get it? You were Santa last year. I du n no. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political. So what are you gon na be? Ah, I'm gon na be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know? Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's? Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's? Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You do n't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday : desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud! Well, for your information, Paolo is gon na be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. Yeah, you wish! It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us - dinner. Yeah, okay. Alright. Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. Woooo! Yeah! Phoebe, you're on. Oh, oh, good. Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh! Thanks, hi. Um, I wan na start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year. I made a man with eyes of coal And a smile so bewitchin', How was I supposed to know That my mom was dead in the kitchen? La lalala la la la la lalala la la...... My mother's ashes Even Lily Buffay eyelashes Are resting in a little yellow jar, And sometimes when it's breezy...... I feel a little sneezy And now I - Excuse me, excuse me! Yeah, noisy boys! Is it something that you would like to share with the entire group? No. No, that's - that's okay. Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear! That guy's going home with a note! Noth - I was - I was just saying to my - Could you speak up please? Sorry, I wa - I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my - in my life. And then Max said that - you said you thought Daryl Hannah. Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked Daryl Hannah in Splash, a lot, but not so much in - in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a Hard quality. - hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that - that - that's when you started yelling. Okay, we're gon na take a short break. Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note! Come here, Marcel. Sit here. Pheebs, I ca n't believe David Hasselhof has n't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean Paolo had already named both my breasts!... Ooh. Did I just share too much? Just a smidge. David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. David Hasselhof's very methodical. I think it's romantic. Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman? Yeah! Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he - David Hasselhof's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just - I just wan na be with David Hasselhof all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gon na ask him to New Year's, are n't you. You're gon na break the pact. Phoebe Buffay's gon na break the pact. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just? Yeah,'cause I already asked Janice. What?! C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! I snapped, okay? I could n't handle the pressure and I snapped. Yeah, but Janice? That - that was like the worst breakup in history! I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped! Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late. Too many jokes... must mock Joey! Nice shoes, huh? Aah, y'killing me! Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again! Okay, look, he's not gon na hurt them, right? Do you always have to bring him here? I did n't wan na leave him alone. Alright? We - we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I did n't mean, and he - he threw some faeces... Y'know, if you're gon na work late, I could look in on him for you. Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me. Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie.... But, you ca n't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions. Okay, alright, I have a question, then. Yuh. Um, were you planning on kissing me ever? Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well,'cause it's you. Sure. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just got ta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella. Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper!... trapped inside a physicist's body. Rrrreally. Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me.... Now? Now? Oh yeah, right now. Okay, okay, okay. Y'know what, this was just really expensive. And I'll take - this was a gift. Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. Okay, what the hell, what the hell. You want me to actually throw you or you - you wan na just hop? I can hop. So tell me something. What does the phrase' no date pact' mean to you? I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody - I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby. Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby? Yeah. You know more than one Fun Bobby? I happen to know a Fun Bob. Okay, here we go... Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk! There. Now there is. Okay, so on our no - date evening, three of you now have dates. Uh, four. Four. Five. Five. Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight. Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do? Okay, so I'm gon na be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops? Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no - one'll know who's with who. Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now. What's the matter? Oh, it's - it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night. Really. Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing. What, uh... what juggling thing? With the balled - up socks? I figured you taught him that. No. Y'know, it was n't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon... Phoebe. Hi. Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody? No. Have you seen David? No, no, he has n't been around. Well, if you see David Hasselhof, tell David Hasselhof to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk. Minsk? Minsk. It's in Russia. I know where Minsk is. We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid. So when, when do you leave? January first. Hello? Hey! Hi. Hi! What - what're you doing here? Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so congratulations! This is so exciting! It'd be even more exciting if we were going. Oh, you're not going? Oh, why? Tell her, David.' I do n't wan na go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wan na stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' Thank you, Max. Thank you. So - so you're really not going? I do n't know. I do n't know what I'm gon na do. I just - you decide. Oh do n't do that. Please. Oh no no. No, but I'm asking - Oh, but I ca n't do that - No, but I ca n't - It's your thing, and - - make the decision - Okay, um, stay. Stay. Stay. Getting so good at that! It was Max's stuff. I love this artichoke thing! Oh, do n't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! You remember Janice. Vividly. Hi. Hi, I'm Sandy. Sandy! Hi! C'mon in!... You brought your kids. Yeah. That's okay, right? Par - tay! That thing is not coming in here.' That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she would n't be welcome in your home? I'm guessing your new girlfriend would n't urinate on my coffee table. Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened... Alright. Just keep him away from me. Thank you. C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling? Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later. Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where - where's Paolo? Rome. Jerk missed his flight. And then... your face is bloated? No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman - this blonde planet with a pocketbook - starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts - starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle... oh... everybody having fun at the party? Are people eating my dip? Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf. Wow, that's, uh, dirty. Yeah. Hey, kids... Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in. There you are! Haaah, you got away from me! But you found me! Here, Ross, take our picture. Smile! You're on Janice Camera! Kill me. Kill me now. Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby! Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he - died about two hours ago. But I-I-I could n't get a flight out' til tomorrow, so here I am! Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who died? It's gon na be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll - I get to see him again. Oh, I'm gon na blow this one up, and I'm gon na write' Reunited' in glitter. Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I did n't necessarily think that it meant that we - Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm sorry you misunderstood... Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gon na be your last chance with me. Oh, will you give me the thing. Hi, Max! Yoko. I've decided to go to Minsk without you. Wow. It wo n't be the same - but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year. Are you alright? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. You're going to Minsk. No, I'm... not going to Minsk. Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You ca n't stay here just'cause of me. Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I ca n't break up with you. Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um,' Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say' your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um,' it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Ca n't you understand that?'. And I say' no! No! I ca n't understand that!'. Uh, ow. Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me. And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me. I'll never forget you. And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you do n't wan na start the new year with me if you ca n't finish it. I'm gon na miss you. You scientist guy. Hi, this is Dick Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square... There y'go, kids. And then the peacock bit me. Please kiss me at midnight. You seen Sandy? Ooh. Uh, I do n't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you. Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing. What? The bll is drrbing! In twenty seconds it'll be midnight... And the moment of joy is upon us. Looks like that no date pact thing worked out. Everybody looks so happy. I hate that. Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby! Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. I du n no. I do n't feel like kissing anyone tonight. I ca n't kiss anyone. So I'm kissing everyone? Nonono, you ca n't kiss Ross, that's your brother. Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me. Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me! Alrightalrightalright. There. I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much does n't love you back.... I think that bitch cracked my tooth. \n","Marcel: [Marcel, he, him, him]\n","Bethel: [Bethel, Bethel]\n","Bethel: [Bethel, Bethel]\n","None\n","None\n","a Ross: [a Ross, Ross, he, you]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","New Year's: [last year, New Year's, New Year's, this New Year, this year]\n","New Year's: [last year, New Year's, New Year's, this New Year, this year]\n","New Year's: [last year, New Year's, New Year's, this New Year, this year]\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo]\n","Paolo: [Paolo, Paolo]\n","None\n","New Year's: [last year, New Year's, New Year's, this New Year, this year]\n","None\n","None\n","Phoebe: [Phoebe, Phoebe]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Max: [Max, Max]\n","Daryl Hannah: [Daryl Hannah, Daryl Hannah, he, his, Daryl Hannah, she, Daryl Hannah]\n","Daryl Hannah: [Daryl Hannah, Daryl Hannah, he, his, Daryl Hannah, she, Daryl Hannah]\n","Daryl Hannah: [Daryl Hannah, Daryl Hannah, he, his, Daryl Hannah, she, Daryl Hannah]\n","None\n","Daryl Hannah: [Daryl Hannah, Daryl Hannah, he, his, Daryl Hannah, she, Daryl Hannah]\n","None\n","None\n","David Hasselhof: [David Hasselhof, David Hasselhof's, he, he, he -

Where? Ooh, come to Momma. He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool. Nice hat. Thanks. We should do something. Whistle. We are not going to whistle. Come on, do it. No! Do it! No! Do it do it do it! Woo - woo! I ca n't believe you did that! Why did I' woo - hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That - that Guy'd turn round and say' I love that sound, I must have you now'? I just wish there was something we could do. Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP! Phoebe, what are you doing? Maybe nobody's tried this. I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, Guy looks smart. I bet Guy's a lawyer. Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic. Okay, Coma Guy's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And - he can dance! Oh! And, Coma Guy's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, Coma Guy's listening, y'know, and not saying' Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked. I wish all guys could be like him. I know. Are there no conscious men in the city for you two? He does n't have anyone. Yeah, we - we feel kinda responsible. I ca n't believe you said woowoo. I do n't even say woowoo. Oh, Mrs. Bing's coming up! Mrs. Bing's coming up! Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book,' Euphoria Unbound' : the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wan na put the kids to bed for this one. Y'know, we do n't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax. No way, forget it. C'mon, Mrs. Bing's your mom! Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No? Chandler, I got ta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I can not get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool! Yeah, well, you would n't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of' Mistress Bitch.' C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think Mrs. Bing's a blast. You can say that because Mrs. Bing's not your mom. Oh, please... Bona sera. Oh, hi sweetie. When did Rigatoni get back from Rome? Last night. Ah, so then his plane did n't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had - but, phew. Hey hey hey! She's on! Ah! Nora Bing!... Now what is this about you - you being arrested i - in London? What is that all about? Your mom was arrested? Shhh, busy beaming with pride.... This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man... Now why would she say that's embarrassing? Shhh.... I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken. THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!! Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going? Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate - but I get to see my son, who I love... Awww! This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone. Y'know, do n't take this wrong, I - I just do n't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I do n't mean that, I do n't mean that bad... Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms.... And then he burst into flames. Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty - five... and - oh, teams played sports. What about Glen? He could be a Glen. Nah... not - not special enough. Ooh! How about Agamemnon? Waaay too special. I am famished. What do I want... Please God do n't let it be Kung Pow Chicken. Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think? Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little. What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place. Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gim me a hug. Well, I think we're ready for some tequila. I know I am. Who's doing shots? Yeah. I'm in. There y'go. Ross? Uh, I'm not really a shot drinking kinda guy. Hi! Sorry - sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time.... But a man can change. Anyone want me to appraise anything? Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer. Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book. Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, any messages for room 226? You okay there, slugger? Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. What is with you tonight? Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing. Okay, thank you. It's the Italian Hand - Licker, is n't it. No. It's the one Paolo's licking. She's supposed to be with you. You're good. Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why? The girl on the cover with Woman 1 nipples showing? No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I can not sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty - five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually kill off. When? Man 1's not a hero.... You know who our hero is. The guy on the cover with his nipples showing? No, it's you! Please. No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy... Right. You are gon na be fine, believe me. Uh-oh... Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street. Hey, is Chandler here? Yeah. Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you did n't tell... Okay,'cause I'm thinking - we do n't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right? Right. No big deal. Okay. In Bizarro World!! You broke the code! What code? You do n't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot - lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom! What are you guys doing out here? Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept. Yeah, well, you do n't have your racket. No, no I do n't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one. Yeah, well you did n't call and leave your grip size. Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum. Ross, how could you let this happen? I do n't know, God, I... well, it's not like Mrs. Bing's a regular mom, y'know? She's, Mrs. Bing's sexy, Mrs. Bing's... You do n't think my mom's sexy? Well... not in the same way... I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children? Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here... Hey. Hey. What're you guys doing out here? Well, not playing raquetball! Ross Geller forgot to leave his grip size! Joey Tribbiani did n't get the goggles! Well, sounds like you two have issues. Goodbye, baby. Ciao, bela. Do they wait for me to do this? So are you gon na tell Chandler Bing? Why would I tell him? How about'cause if you do n't, his mother might. Oh... What are you guys doing here? Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!... What did I ask? Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here? I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off... on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me? No. No! No!... So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning? How would I know? I - I was n't here. Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! Oh my God. You're my friend. I - I had to tell you. I ca n't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom? Yeah, um, I do n't know if you noticed, but Paolo had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when Paolo's drun.. uh... I ca n't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom. What? I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora - um, Mrs. Mom - your Bing - was just being nice, y'know, and - But nothing happened, nothing - Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in - You knew about this? Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing. I spent the entire day with you, why did n't you tell me?! Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what would a happened. Thanks, man, big help. I ca n't believe this! What the hell were you thinking? I was n't - I mean, I - Y'know, of all my friends, no - one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you. I know - I ca n't believe you did this. Chandler - Me neither, y'know what - I'm still mad at you for not telling me. What are you mad at me for?! Chandler - You got ta let me slam the door! Chandler, I did n't kiss Mrs. Bing, Ross Geller did! See what happens when you break the code? Joey - Ah! Huh? Hey. Hey.' A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'. Yeah. Thought I'd give it a shot. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his' love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'? Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no' j' in' engorged'. Hey Rach. Hey. Hello. Hello. Going to the hospital tonight? No, you? No, you? You just asked me. Okay, maybe it was a trick question. Um, Rachel can we do this now? Okay. I am so hot! Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me Gloria Tribbiani's not a knockout. I can not believe we're having this conversation. C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all. Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay. Thanks. Hi, um,' kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.' Kay. You do n't have to be awake to be my man, As long as you have brainwaves I'll be there to hold your hand. Though we just met the other day, There's something I have got to say... Okay, thank you very much, I'm gon na take a short break! Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo! What was that? Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a... Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother - Kisser? Mother - Kisser... I'll shut up. Chandler, can I just say something? I - I know you're still mad at me, I just wan na say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips. Yes, well, I expect this from Mrs. Bing. Okay? Mrs. Bing's always been a Freudian nightmare. Okay, well, if Mrs. Bing always behaves like this, why do n't you say something? Because it's complicated, it's complex - Hey, you kissed my mom! We're rehearsing a Greek play. That's very funny. We done now? No! Okay, you mean, you're not gon na talk to her, you're not gon na tell her how you feel? That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom does n't mean you know Mrs. Bing. Alright? Trust me, you ca n't talk to her. Okay,' you' ca n't, or you ca n't? Okay, that's my finger. That's, that's my knee. Still doing the play. Aaah! Alright, whadyou do with him? Oh! You're awake! Look at you! How, how do you feel? Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay. You look good! I feel good!... Who are you? Oh, sorry. I'm Phoebe Buffay. I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you. Well, we both have. So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys? Well, actually it's just from me. I got you the foot massager. You know who shaved you? That was me. I read to you. I sang. Hah! Well,... thanks. Oh, my pleasure. You're welcome. So. I guess I'll see you around. What, that's it? \" See you around? \" Well, what do you want me to say? Oh, I do n't know. Maybe, um, \" That was nice? \" Admit something to me? \" I'll call you? \" Alright, I'll call you. I do n't think you mean that. This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then - we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and \" See you around! \" Let's go, Phoebe. Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma. Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon? No, just knowing you're gon na be there is enough. Alright, well, be good, I love you. You kissed my best Ross!... Or something to that effect. O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid. Really stupid. Really stupid. And I do n't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now? Yeah. No. No... Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door. Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything. You're kidding. No, no. He said \" When are you gon na grow up and start being a mom? \" Wow! Then she came back with \" The question is, when are you gon na grow up and realise I have a bomb? \"' Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she did n't say \" When are you gon na grow up and realise I am your mom? \" That makes more sense. So, what's going on now? I du n no, I've been standing here spelling it out for you! I do n't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Whaddya see? Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside - down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run! You okay, kiddo? Yeah, okay. Alright. Nice save. Mrs. Bing. Mr. Geller. Hey. You mean that? Yeah, why not. So I told her. Yeah? How'd it go? Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse. Well, howdya feel? Pretty good! I told her. Well, see? So, maybe it was n't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh? But.. we do n't have to go down that road. Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not' reaching for her heaving beasts'. What's a' niffle'? You usually find them on the' heaving beasts'. Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist... Wait, did you get to the part about his' huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you do n't wan na be around when he starts writing with those! Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!

Ross, did you really read all these baby books? Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! Ooh, this is cool... it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. And, we're done with the yogurt. Sorry. Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas? Nice talk, Aunt Syl. You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth? Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big? This is your baby. Hi Daddy! Hello! How come you do n't live with Mommy? How come Mommy lives with that other lady? What's a lesbian? Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos Ah, poke a nose, mmm Mma, Mma, Mmaah So, did I hear Poconos? Yes, my sister's giving us Jill Green place for the weekend. Woo - hoo, first weekend away together! Yeah, that's a big step. I know... Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal! Was n't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Should n't it be... flung by now? I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with Paolo, I'm totally, totally...... nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration? I could call immigration! I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands... Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever! Need a new table. You think? Hey hey, come on in! Hey, hello! mmwa! I brought all the books, and Monica sends Monica Geller love, along with this lasagna. Oh great! Is it vegetarian,'cause Susan does n't eat meat. I'm pretty sure that it is... So, I got the results of the amnio today. Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....? Totally and completely healthy! Oh, that's great, that is great! Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis? Uh, that's our friend Tanya. Of course it's your friend Tanya. Do n't you want to know about the sex? The sex? Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya, yaw... The sex of the baby, Ross. Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh - oh - oh! Do you want to know? No, no, no, no, no, I do n't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is! Or is n't... Oh, hello Ross! Susan... So, so, did you hear? Yes, we did, everything's A-OK! Oh, that's so... It really is... do we know...? Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be...

All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? Hello? Uh, never mind, I do n't want to know. Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one? That's the rule. What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table! How'd you get to that? Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio You knew about that? Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination. Ok, ok, How about if we split it? What do you mean, like, buy it together? Yeah You think we're ready for something like that? Why not? Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out? Why, are you moving out? I'm not moving out. You'd tell me if you were moving out right Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip... Aw, I know all about Kip! It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly. Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me? Aw, do n't do that We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled Customer 5:30 shiatsu. Ok, thanks. Oh, here comes your 3:00. I do n't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe! Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here? Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh? Well, Racquela's right, yeah! Oh, okay, I do n't know what you just said, so let's get started. Uh, I am, uh, being naked? Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off... oh whoops! You're being naked! I ca n't believe you do n't want to know. I mean, I could n't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows.... And Monica knows... Wha, heh, how could you know, I do n't even know! Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, Carol Willick told me. So what's it gon na be? Waitohheyhuh, oh great now Joey Tribbiani knows, and I do n't know! I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt! Or an uncle... Hey Phoebe! Hi Pheebs! Pheebs! Fine! Phoebe, what's the matter? Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts. Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here? Oh, right, that's me! Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on. Fine. Phoebe, what is it? All right, you know Paolo? I'm familiar with his work, yes... Well, Paolo made a move on me. Whoa, store will be open tomorrow! More coffee over here, please! Well, what happened? Well, Paolo came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. Ooooohh! My God. Are you sure? Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands were n't the problem anymore. Was it...? Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there. Oooooo.... \" Ooo, \" what? Uma Thurman. Oh! The actress! Thanks Rach. So what are you gon na do? You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? Oh, yeah, you have to tell Rachel Green. Feminist issue. That's where I went! Rachel Green is gon na hate me. Yeah, well... Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? That's patio furniture! So what, like people are gon na come in and think, \" Uh - oh, I'm outside again? \" Of course! What about the birds? I do n't know, birds just do n't say, \" Hello, sit here, eat something. \" You pick one. All right, how about the ladybugs? Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining! Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds! Not like that, I wo n't! Kip would have liked the birds! Hey! Hi Pheebs! Are you moving out? No, these are n't all my suitcases. This one's Paolo's. Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec? Well, sure... just a sec, though,'cause Paolo's on his way over. Oh! Ok, um, ok, um, Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs... Ok, um, we have n't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?! Oh, I do n't make them a lot because I do n't think it's fair to the other cookies All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Which proves that I never lie. I guess you do n't. Paolo made a pass at me. So, what do you think? I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen. I know! So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads? Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play! Heads up Ross! Score! You suck! Are you okay? I need some milk. Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better? No... oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all \" Oh, Paolo, he's so great, Paolo makes me feel so... \" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed! I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on! Pheebs, if I had never met Paolo this never would have happened! I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about? I do n't know... right, he's the pig! Such a pig! Oh, God, he's such a pig, Oh Paolo's like a... He's like a big disgusting...... like a...... pig... pig man! Yes, good! Ok... Oh, but Paolo was my pig man... how did I not see this? Oh! I know! It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you... Ok, Ok, Pheebs... The end. Oh, God... Should I not have told you? No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better... I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so... We should get over there and see if she's okay. Just one... second! Score! Game! Come on. Ah... ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts. No - no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing - there team. Come on, two on one. What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in! What, now? Yes, now is when you swoop! You got ta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's got ta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo! My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! No, that's cold, that's cold, that's... How's it going? Do n't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm - waving,, Ok, that is either, \" How could you? \" or, \" Enormous breasts! \" Here he comes! Ooh! Uh, I am, uh, to say good - bye. Oh, ok bye - bye. Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel, but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles. Grazie. Paolo, I - I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... Oh, just look at her... Oh you guys, I - I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed... Oh, you're right.... and I really think it should be me. Hey. Hey. You all right? Ooh, I've been better... Come here. Listen, you deserve so much better than him... you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you. Oh, Ross... What? I am so sick of guys. I do n't want to look at another guy, I do n't want to think about another guy, I do n't even want to be near another guy. Huh. Oh Ross, you're so great! Ohhhh Ooh... hey honey, are you all right? Oh... You ok?... medium... hmm... any cookies left? Yep! See, Rach, uh, see, I do n't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really do n't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process. No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want Uh, no, no, see, because not... not all guys are going to be a Paolo. No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one. What? What? I - I'm, I'm having a boy? Uh... no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy. Wha - I'm having, I'm having a boy! Huh, am I having a boy? Yes, you're having a boy! I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy! Wha - Wha - What is it? I'm having a boy! I - I'm having a boy! Hey! Hey! We already knew that! I'm having a son. Um... Yes! And that would be a shut - down! Shut - out!!

You just barge in here, you do n't knock I'm sorry! You have no respect for anybody's privacy! Rachel, wait, wait. No, you wait! This is ridiculous! Can I just say one thing? What? What?! That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas. Oh!! Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower. That's pretty much it. Oops! But you tell it really well, sweetie. Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you. Okay. I'll miss you. Is n't he great? He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much. I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know? So, you think you'll do it on his couch? Oh, I do n't know, I do n't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl. Okaaay. Any of you guys want anything else? Oh, yes, could I have one of those. No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else? Okay. Did I, uh, did I miss something? No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies. You what? Wh what were you doing seeing her boobies? It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts. Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please? Yeah,'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts. Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change. Y'know, I do n't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies. Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice. Okaaay, rock, hard place, me. You're so funny! He's really funny! I would n't wan na be there when when the laughter stops. Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that? Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance. Huh. I mean hey! I just met you, I do n't know you from Adam.... Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty. Uhhuh, how did you know that? It's textbook. Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right? Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib! Hey, how long are you in the city? Just for a coupla days. I got a job midtown. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry. I do n't know this one. Oh, this is my friend Roger. Hi. Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger. You too, sir. What happened to the, uh, puppet guy? Dad, dad. Oh,' scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife? Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny! Got ta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this is n't Ma? Ronni Rappelano name's Ronni. Ronni Rappelano's a pet mortician. Sure. So how long you been... Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? Since then?! No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I was n't always such a terrible guy.... Joe. Y'ever been in love?... I d'know. Then y'have n't. You're burning your tomatoes. You're one to talk. Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. Oh man. Please tell me one of' em is Ma. Of course, course one of' em's Ma. What's the matter with you. It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. Mr. Tribbiani's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows! I know, I mean, why ca n't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why ca n't you stop staring at my breasts? What? What? Did you not get a good enough look the other day? Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw Rachel Green boobies, I think, uh, you're gon na have to show her your peepee. Y'know, I do n't see that happening? C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat. Well I'm not showing you my' tat.' Hello? It's Phoebe. And Rog. C'mon up. Oh, good. Rog is here. What's the matter with Rog? Yeah. Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy. What, so Roger was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, Roger's not that bad. Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry Carol Willick if I thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian? I du n no. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why? I do n't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you... Wait - wait, go back to that sibling thing. Well, I do n't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. That that's ridiculous! I do n't feel guilty for Monica Geller failures! Oh! So you think I'm a failure! Is n't Roger good? Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying... Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better! Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good! You're right! I mean you're right! It was n't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gon na catch that movie, we got ta get going. Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel,' kay? Geez, we're gon na be late, sweetie... Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon. You're welcome. Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love. Hate that guy! Night, you guys. Oh look, it's the woman we ordered. Hey. Can, uh, can we help you? Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani. I'm Joey Tribbiani. Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures! I - I'm, I'm Ronni.... Cheese Nip? Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know? Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want' em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail, or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee. Joey, if I go first, I wan na be looking for my keys. That's a good one! Hey, Joe. Dad, Ronni's here. Huh? Hi. Hey! Hello, babe! Wh what're what're you doing here? Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. Thank you. Uh... So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk? Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I - I'd better get going, I do n't wan na miss the last train. I do n't want you taking that thing. Oh, where'm I gon na stay, here? Who - ah - ho. We'll go to a hotel. We'll go to a hotel. No you wo n't. No we wo n't. If you go to a hotel you'll be... doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you. You're gon na keep an eye on us? That's right, mister, and I do n't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gon na live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend. Wow. Joey Tribbiani's strict. Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room. Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid. C'mon, I'll show you to my room.... That sounds so weird when it's not followed by \" No thanks, it's late. \" Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you got ta make a change. This has gone on long enough. What kinda change? Well, either you break it off with Ronni I ca n't do that! Then you got ta come clean with Ma! This is not right! Yeah, but this is I do n't wan na hear it! Now go to my room! Hey, Kicky. What're you doing? Just trying to get comfortable. I ca n't sleep in my underwear. Well, you're gon na. I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls... Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe - fitting business, did you cave? No. No. You decided to go into the out-of - work actor business. Now that was n't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \" No thanks, I'm married. \" You really think so? Yeah. I really do. Thanks, Chandler. Get off! Hi. Hi... May I help you? Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours? Okay... who are you? Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress? Oh, c'mon in. Thanks. Hi, I'm Rachel. Hi. Bathroom's up there. Great. Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower? Oh, like, uh, five minutes? Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib. Hey. Morning, dear. Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing. What's the matter with you?! I thought it was Chandler! What? What? You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing! Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. Hey, Pheebs. Hey. How's it going? Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and Roger wanted me to invite you guys. So what's going on? Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. I du n no, there's just something about... Basically we just feel that Roger's... We hate that guy. Yeah. Hate him. We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, do n't you think, maybe, though, it's just that Roger's so perceptive that it freaks you out?... No, we hate him. We're sorry. Ma! What're you doing here? I came to give you this and this. Oww! Big ring! Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. Hold on, you - you knew? Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \" I'm sleeping over at my accountant's, \" I mean, what is that? Please! So then how could you I mean, how could you?! Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made Mr. Tribbiani happy, nothing made Mr. Tribbiani happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, Mr. Tribbiani has a hobby. Ma, I do n't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you? Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no Ronni Rappelano, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle - stuffer came along, Mr. Tribbiani's been so ashamed of himself that Mr. Tribbiani's been more attentive, Mr. Tribbiani's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary. I'm... happy... for you? Well do n't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was. Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her? Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is. That's sweet. Could I take Ronni Rappelano? With this ring? No contest. What's wrong, sweetie? Nothing, nothing. Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They - they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they do n't. Oh. They do n't. But they do n't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They do n't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little... What? Intense and creepy. Oh. But I do n't. Me, Phoebe. Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. You're not? See, that's why you're so great! Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all' Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'. So you talked to your dad, huh. Yeah. He's gon na keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gon na keep pretending she does n't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina ca n't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order... which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today. Wow. Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain. So Joey, you okay? Yeah, I guess. It's just parents, after a certain point, you got ta let go. Even if you know better, you've got ta let them make their own mistakes. Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them. If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty - year - old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom. Hey. Hey, Pheebs. How's it going? Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger. Awww. Yeah, right. Aaawwwwww!! What happened? I do n't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy! Hey, Joey. What's going on? Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop : Rachel Green. Joey!! What the hell were you doing?! Sorry. Wrong boobies. Hello, Joey. Oh!...

The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbianI do n't think we need a third... Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks. An egg? Yeah, you're gon na go up to Woman and say, \" Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg. \" I think it's winning. I think it's insane. Woman'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend. Think it'll work? No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg. You can not do this. Do what, do what? Roger wants to take Phoebe Buffay out tomorrow night. No! Phoebes! Do n't you remember why you dumped the guy?' Cause Roger was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do. Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night? Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... No, no, no, do n't you dare bail on me. The only reason Joey's date's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. Yes, I know, but Joey's date friend sounds like such a... Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha - ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. Hi. Woman 1 said yes. Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh? How do I look? Oh, uh, I... do n't... care. Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess. Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice.... And what did you bring? She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gon na go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice. Janice? Oh.... my.... God. Hey, it's Janice. Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window. No, no, no, do n't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months! Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I ca n't go when I'm nervous. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right. Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!! Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but Roger was nothing compared to Pete Carney. Which one was Pete Carney? Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex. \" Was it good for you? \" Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard - the - \" I - win \" - guy. \" I win! I win! \" I went out with the guy for two monthsI did n't get to win once. How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people! I do n't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets. I know I am. That's why I ca n't wear a digital watch. There's more beer, right? Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves Abby head? Abby said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual. Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald. Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect. Ok, well, what kind of ritual? Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us. Or? Or... or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks. Burning's good. Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn. You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. That's OK. Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. We ca n't do that. What? What ca n't you do? Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? Uh, we might be leaving now. Tell me it's \" you and me \" we. Lorraine said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it. Ok, you can not do this to me. You're right, I'm sorry. You're right. Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please? I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler. I hope Lorraine throws up on you. So... Just us. Oh, what a crappy night! Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom. Excuse me. How ya doin'? So, do we have the best friends or what? Joey's not a friend. Joey Tribbiani's... a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV? I will go for that drink. You got it. Good woman! Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne? Each. That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy. I've always wanted to know... Happy Valentine's Day! Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened? No... no! And yet it did. Good - bye, Janice. Kiss me! Oh, Chandler, sorry. Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice. Hi, Monica. Ok, well, this was very special. Rach, come see who's out here! Oh my god. Janice, hi! Janice is gon na go away now. I'll be right back. Oh, Joey, look who it is. Whoa. Oh, good, Joey's home now. This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall. Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to. Ross Geller just happened to call. Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he does n't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half. That's funny. Who are they? The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching Carol Willick is her... close, personal friend. You mean they're lovers. If you wan na put a label on it. Wow, uh, anything else I should know? Nope, nope, that's it. Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part. Helloo! Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine. All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca. Um, that's ok! Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man. Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we would n't be doing the ritual in the first place. Can we just start throwing things in? Ok, yeah, ok. Oh, OK. Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts. Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah. Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked. Hey he's wearing a sweater. No. Eww! And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa. Hey, Rachel, is n't that stuff almost pure... How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day? I do n't know. You dumped her on New Year's. Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush. Hello, funny Valentine. Hi, Just Janice. Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gon na! If you do n't do it, I will. So, um, what do you do for a living? Well, um, for the past few years I've been working..... which is funny because, that was n't even my major. Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. I thought they could... I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. Now that is funny. Hey, do you think... would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?' Cause Carol Willick's, Carol Willick's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad. I guess. Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wan na come over and join us? Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine. Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, wo n't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin...... does something that, funnily enough, was n't even Kristin major! What do we got there? A piece of something : boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half - charred pictureWow, that guy's hairier than the Chief! You know, it's a really funny story how this happened. It's all right. It's all right. You do n't have to explain. This is n't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control. You're our third call tonight. Really? Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year. I brought you something. Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever. I had them made special. Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just do n't things are gon na work out. That's fine. It is? Mmm - hmm. Because I know that this is n't the end. Oh no, you see, actually it is. No, it is n't, because you wo n't let that happen. Do n't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing. Oh, no I do n't. Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed? I did, but... You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You ca n't live without me. And you know it. You just do n't know you know it. See ya. Call me! It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine. You did so. I swear, I swear How long has she been in the bathroom? Uh, I do n't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone. Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years. That could be it. Oh, god. You know, this is still pretty hot. Mushroom. Smile. They wo n't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny No, it's just... you know the whole \" getting on with your life \" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I do n't, I do n't have to... You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know what you're gon na say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You ca n't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you. Oh, I love you too. But... No but, no but. You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you. That's easy for you to say, you found one already. All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set. Not her. We get off around midnight, why do n't we pick you up then? So, um, will you bring the truck? I'll even let you ring the bell. Oh, my god. See, there you go, the cleansing works! They're nice guys. Oh, they're firemen guys. You guys tell them you were married? No way! Are you kidding?

Thank you. Cappuccino. Grazie. And a nice hot cider for Monica. Aww, thank you. Uh Rach? Yeah? Why does my cinamon stick have an eraser? Oh! That's why. I'm sorry! Chandler. Mrs. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you. Yes. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day. Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really. Nothing. Hey you guys! Chandler's coming and Chandler Bing says Chandler Bing has, like, this incredible news, so when Chandler Bing gets here, we could all act like, you know... Hey! Hey! Never mind. But it was going to be really good. What's going on? What is it? So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. That's great! So.... I quit. Why? Why? This was supposed to be a temp job! Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years. If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. So was it a lot more money? It does n't matter. I just do n't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.... the WENUS? Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term. Oh. That WENUS. So what're you going to do? I do n't know. That's the thing. I do n't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve? Anyway, Steve's opening up a restaurant and Steve's looking for a head chef. Um... hi there. Hi! Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so.... Yeah... I just do n't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all - toast restaurant. Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is Steve looking for? Well, Steve wants to do some ecclectic, so Steve's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu. Oh my God! Yeah, I know! So, what do you think? Thanks, Phoebe. But I just do n't really see myself in a big white hat. OK. Oh Monica! Guess what! Can you see my nipples through this shirt? No. But do n't worry, I'm sure they're still there. Where are you going, Mr. Suity - Man? Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo. I added the \" a - gogo. \" Career counselor? Hey, you guys all know what you want to do. I do n't! Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I do n't have a dream. Ah, the lesser - known \" I do n't have a dream \" speech. Oh, I love my life, I love my life! Ooh! Brian's Song! The meeting with the guy went great? So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for Steve Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, Steve really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because then you can' ooh' and' ahh' and make yummy noises. What are you going to make? Yummy noises. And Monica, what are you going to make? I do n't know. I do n't know. It's just going to be so great! Ooh! I know what you could make! I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I do n't know. Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood? How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32 - ounce steak, it's free. OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma? Who are you going out with? Oh, is this the bug lady? Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross. Her name is Celia. Celia's not a bug lady. Celia's curator of insects at the museum. So what are you guys going to do? Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring Celia back to my place and I'd introduce Celia to my monkey. And he's not speaking metaphorically. So.... back to your place... you thinking, maybe... huh - huh? Well, I do n't know.... huh - huh.... but I'm hoping huh - huh. I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. Celia, do n't worry! Do n't scream! He's not going to hurt you! Soothing tones, Celia. Soothing tones! Marcel... I ca n't stand this! He's got his claws in my... Alright... OK, try this salmon mousse. Mmmm. Good. Is it better than the other salmon mousse? It's creamier. Yeah, well, is that better? I do n't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know? My God! What happened to you? Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? \" You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation. \" That's so great!' Cause you already know how to do that! Can you believe it? I mean, do n't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing something... something. Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt! Here you go, maybe this'll cheer you up. Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz - bouche. Well.... it is amouz - ing... Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. Ten dollars an hour for what? Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if Wendy'd help me out. Waitressing? Uh-oh. Well... of course I thought of you! But... but... But, but? But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress. Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics. You know, I do n't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76. Amouz - bouche? Talk to me. OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning... No no no. Talk... dirty. Wha... what, here? Yes... Ah.... Say something..... hot. Er.... um..... What? Um... uh.... vulva. Vulva? Alright, I panicked, alright? Celia took me by surprise. You know, but it was n't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling. Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?? Shut up! It was nice. I just... I do n't think I'm the dirty - talking kind of guy, you know? What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to Celia. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. Please be kidding. Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. OK. I'm in my apartment....... yeah... what else? That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. Alright, look, I'll start, OK? Joey, please. Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. Wow. Alright, now you say something. I... ahem... I really do n't think so. Come on! You like this woman, right? Yeah. You want to see her again, right? Sure. Well if you ca n't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to Celia? Now tell me you want to caress my butt! OK, turn around. I just do n't want you staring at me when I'm doing this. Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead. Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips. There you go! Keep going. Keep going! I, er... I want to take my tongue... and....... and.... Say it... say it!... run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with....... with?? Funny story! You're not going to believe this! It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together. Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again. Again? And again, and again, and again... Hello? And again. Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor? Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know? Well, that's very generous er, but look, this is n't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier? Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection! No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! Well? Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube. Look at this! Oh! You have a window! Yes indeedy! With a beautiful view of... Oh look! That guy's peeing! OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down. OK. This is great! Helen, could you come in here for a moment? Thank you Helen, that'll be all. Last time I do that, I promise. Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Who was that? Wendy bailed. I have no waitress. Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. Ten dollars an hour. No. Twelve dollars an hour. Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around. You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you... twenty dollars an hour. Done. Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat? Hi Steve! Hello, Monica. Hello, greeter girl. This is Rachel. Yeah, OK. Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I ca n't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of of, OK, smells. It's a lovely apartment. Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour? I was just being polite, but, alright. What's up? In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie. What? Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja? OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK. Is it dry in here? Let me, let me get you some wine! Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course. OK, um, these are rot - shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce...... with just a touch of mints... and...... ginger. Well, smack my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic! I'm so glad you liked them! Like' em? I could eat a hundred of them! Oh, well... um, that's all there are of these. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. Excuse me? Can I help you with anything? You know, I do n't know what I'm looking for. Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope. You know that? You do n't want to spoil your appetite. Hey! Sugar - O's! You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes... Macaroni and cheese! We got ta make this! No, we do n't. Oh, OK. Oh, sorry. Why do n't you just have a seat here? OK... give me the Gummi - bears. No. Give them to me. Alright, we'll share. No, give me the... Well then you ca n't have any. Bear overboard! I think he's drowning. Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar - O... save yourself! \" Help! I'm drowning! Help! \" That's it! Dinner is over! What? What? Why? Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you ca n't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet? Hey! What a tool! You do n't want to work for a guy like that. Yeah! I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it. Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef. Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I was n't faking. So, er... how did it go with Celia? Oh, I was unbelievable. All right, Ross! I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers. Whoa! And the... huh - huh? Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so uh... You cuddled. Yeah, which was nice. You guys wan na try and catch a late movie or something? Maybe, but should n't we wait for Chandler? Yeah, where the hell is he? Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good! Whooooaaaa.... How's this? Eeeee! Sorry. How about over here? Aaaaah! See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? No. What about this? Aaaaahhh!!

I dont know whether hes testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, \" supposedly \" by accident. No, yeah, Ive done that. And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did, and peed all over the crossword. Ive never done that.

I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, Ursula brought me a tuna meltt and four plates of curly fries. Score. Ursula is so hot! Yeah, listen. Okay, before you do anything Joey - like, you might wan na run it by err... Pheebs? Yeah? You think it would be okay if I asked out your sister? Why? Why would you wan na... do that? Why?

So what do you propose to do? I will flip you for it. Flip me for it? No, no, no... heads, heads, heads! On your back... Mom. Alright, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath. Good. Now imagine your vagina is opening like a flower. Mr. D, hows it going, sir? Ohh, its been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in. And? Its pretty ugly. We havent seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies. So what does this mean? Well, were gon na be layin off people in every department. Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very & ndash ; Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone? Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina. Are you okay? Yes, yes I am. Err, listen, the reason that I called you in here today was, err... please dont hate me. What? Would you like to have dinner sometime? So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday? Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me. Okay... Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree and Evelyn? Ooh! Bath salts would be nice. Ooh, okay... good. What is this place? Look, youre cold, I have to pee, and..... theres a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be? I think we have an answer. Whats Phoebe Buffay doing here? This could be Gods way of telling us to eat at home. Think Phoebe Buffay got fired at Riffs? No, no, no. We were there last night. Phoebe Buffay kept..... bringing swordfish. are you gon na go to the, um? Im gon na wait till after we order. Its Phoebe Buffay, right. It looks like Phoebe Buffay. Um, excuse me. Yeah? Hi, its us. Right, and its me. So, so youre here too? Much as you are. Your turn. Err... we know what we want. Oh, thats good. All we want is two Caffe Lattes. And some biscottie cookies. Good choice. Definitely Phoebe Buffay. Yeah. I cant believe you. You still havent told that girl Nina Bookbinder doesnt have a job yet? Well, you still havent taken down the Christmas lights. Congratulations, I think youve found the worlds thinnest argument. Im just trying to find the right moment, you know? Oh, well, that shouldnt be so hard, now that youre dating. \" Sweetheart, youre fired, but how bout a quickie before I go to work? \" Hey. Hey. You know, once youre inside, you dont have to knock any more. I'll get it. Oh. Hi, Mr. Heckles. Youre doing it again. Were not doing anything. Were just sitting around talking, quietly. I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats cant sleep. You dont even have cats. I could have cats. Goodbye Mr. Heckles. Well try to keep it down. Phoebe, could you do me a favour? Could you try this on? I just wan na make sure it fits. Ooh, my first birthday present..... oh, this is really... Oh, no no no. Its for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size - wise. Ohhh... Sure, yeah..... okay, it fits. Are you seein Ursula again tonight? Yep. Ice Capades. Wow, this is serious. Ive never known you to pay money for any kind of capade. I dont know. I like her, you know. Shes different. Theres uh, somethin about Ursula. That you like, we get it. You like Ursula. Great! Hey, Phoebe, I asked you, and you said it was okay. Alright, well, maybe now its not okay. Okay... Well maybe now I'm not okay with it not being okay. Okay. Knit, good woman, knit, knit! And thats the Chrysler Building right there. Nina. Mr. Douglas..... cool tie. Shes still here. Yes, yes Nina Bookbinder is. Didnt I memo you on this? See, after I let Nina Bookbinder go, err, I got a call from Nina Bookbinder psychiatrist, Dr. Flanen - nen, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan. And err, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly, in fact, Dr. Flanen uh, mentioned the word frenzy. Youre kidding? She seems so... Oh, no, no. Nina..... Nina Bookbinder is whooo wewee - woo whoo whoo! In fact, if you asked Nina Bookbinder right now, Nina Bookbinder would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all. Thats unbelievable. And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire Nina Bookbinder again until I can be assured that she will be no threat to herself, or others. I see. I guess you never really know whats goin on inside a persons head. Well, I guess thats why they call it psychology, sir... a sound Mom and Dad never forget. For this after all, is the miracle of birth. Lights please? And thats having a baby. Next week is our final class. Susan, go deep. This is impossible. Its just impossible. What is, honey? What that woman... did. I am not doin that. Its just gon na have to stay in, thats all, everything will be the same, itll just stay in. Carol, honey, shhh, shhh, everythings gon na be alright. Oh, what do you know? No one's going up to you and saying, \" Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it? \" Carol, Carol, sweetie. Cleansing breath. I know its frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when its over, were all gon na be parents for the rest of our lives. I mean, thats what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross? Im gon na be a father. This is just occurring to you? I always knew I was havin a baby, I just never realised the baby was having me. Oh, youre gon na be great! Aw, how can you say that? I cant even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gon na raise a kid? You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different. Wherere you going? Out. With? Yes. Alright, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know... like... you know... you know... yet? Well, not that its any of your business, but, no, we havent, okay? You meant sex, right? Do you have a sec? Ah, sure, Nina. Whats up? I dont know. For the past couple days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks. Oh, well, ah... maybe thats because theyre ah... jealous, of us. Maybe. But that doesnt explain why they keep taking my scissors. Ah, well, maybe thats, ah, because youre getting a big raise. I am? Sure, why not? Oh my god! Youre amazing! Oh, you dont know. Helen, could you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinders raise? So you still want me to send her psychological profile to Personnel? What? Helen drinks. Will you marry me? Well, I ended up telling her everything. Oh, howd she take it? Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip : if youre ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand..... on the desk. Okay, I think I get how to do this. Alright, so, can we turn this off? Can we just make it... make them go away? Because I cant, I cant watch. okay, Pheebs, theyre gone. Okay. Are you alright? Yeah. Its just, you know, its this whole stupid Ursula thing, its... Okay, Pheebs, can I ask? So, hes going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible? Um, yeah. Look, I mean, Im not saying shes like evil or anything. She just, you know, shes always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldnt let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. And then, oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like... Have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend? No. Well, but thats what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then... broke his heart... and then he wouldnt even talk to me any more. Because he said he didnt wan na be around... anything that looked like either one of us. Oh... Oh, Pheebs. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but... Youre not gon na lose him. Hon, you got ta talk to Joey. Yeah. Okay. No, come on, he doesnt know this stuff. If he knew how you felt. But hes falling in love with her. Oh please, theyve been going out a week. They havent even slept together yet, I mean, thats not serious. Okay... Okay. Oh, okay, oh. Oh. Yeah, um, may we help you? Rachel, what are you doing? Its freezing out here. Would you come back inside? No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so..... Im takin em down. Okay? Whoa! Oh - my - god Rachel! Rachel! Im okay! Im okay!

Ow ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and and Rachel Green fell off the balcony and may have broken Rachel Green foot or or ankle or something. My god. You still have your Christmas lights up? Fill this out and bring it back to me. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Okay, ooh, alright. Name, address... Okay, in case of emergency, call? You. Really? Yeah. Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh, love you. Insurance? Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. you do n't have insurance? Why, how much is this gon na cost? I have no idea, but X-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars. Wel - wel - well what are we gon na do? Well there's not much we can do. Um... unless, unless I use yours. Hah, no no no no no no no no no no. well, now, wait a second, who did I just put as my \" In case of emergency \" person? That's insurance fraud. Well, alright, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow ow ow ow! Okay, okay. I hate this. Thank you. Thank you. I love you. Hi, um, I'm gon na need a new set of these forms. Why? I am really an idiot. you see, I was filling out my friend's form, and instead of putting Rachel Green information, I put mine. You are an idiot.. yep, that's me, I am that stupid. I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid. That's nice. No, no, with Ben. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby... and I, I know I've got ta do something'cause the Tampa Bay defence is comin' right at me. Tampa Bay's got a terrible team. Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, hah - hah, I just heave it down field. What are you crazy? That's a baby! Ross Geller should take the sack? Anyway, suddenly I'm down field, and I realise that I'm the one who's supposed to catch Ben, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gon na get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See I, I am so not ready to be a father. Hey, you're gon na be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gon na make a great dad. Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive? Well, only if you order stuff. I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday. Wo - wo - whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday? When's that? Tonight. Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening? You take your time. There it is! So what're you gon na do? What can I do? Look, I do n't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula. And your friend Phoebe? Well, if Phoebe Buffay's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, would n't you guys? Man, if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit... you add a pinch of saffron, it makes all the difference. Okay, errrr, Monica? Yes?.. yes, Rachel Green is. Hi, this is my friend Rachel. Hi. Hi, err Rachel. I'm Dr. Mitchell. And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosen. Are n't you a little cute to be a doctor? Excuse me? I meant er, young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh good, Rach. Thank you. Right... so, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it. Uh, you left out the stupid part. Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said \" yes. \" I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. You know, I say we blow off the dates. What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute! Alright, what have we learned so far? SURPRISE!!! What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me. Was that the cake? Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon schmush. Come on, Betty'll be here any minute. I hope it's okay. Oh... \" Happy Birthday Peehe. \" Well maybe we can make a, a, a' B' out of one of those roses. Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools. Hey, what's going on? Oh, we just... Surprise! oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, Hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room, Where's Joey? Did you see Betty? I tell you one thing, I would n't mind having a piece of this sun - dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd say \" get out of my office! \" Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all? I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea andndash ; Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of... panicky, \" Oh my god I'm gon na be a father \" kind of a thing? No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I was n't around that much. Is that what this is about? No, no, Dad, I was just wondering.' Cause there's time to make up for that. We can do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How' bout we do that? Thanks, Dad, really, I ju... you know, I just, I just needed to know, um... when did you start to feel like a father? Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you do n't wan na go to Williamsburg? No, we can go to Williamsburg. Eat your fish. Rachel, the cute doctors are here. Okay, coming! Hi, come on in. Hey. Hi, Geoffrey. Hi. Ah here, we brought wine. Look at this, it's from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist? Oh, that's great. Look at that. So, Monica, how's the ankle? It's uh..... well, why do n't you tell them? After all it, is your ankle. You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you, um... Well, listen, why do n't you two sit down and, and we'll get you some glasses... okay... STAT! Okay, listen, I'm thinking, why do n't we just tell them who we really are? I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine. It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble. Oh, Monica! Would you stop being such a wuss? A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, okay? So? So... they sss - still seem normal. That's because they are. okay, but you have to admit that every time we go out... Women we meet at the hospital... It turns into... Willya relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this. I said we are not going to do it, okay? Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby. I am not a baby! You know what? I swear to god, just because you get so uptight every time we... Sure, every time, you're such a princess... You know what? What? You know what? What!? You know what? What!!? Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother. Hello! Here we go! This is a great place. How long have you lived here? Thanks! I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago. Yeah..... see, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Really? Yeah... Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but haha, hey, that's me. Why do n't you try the hummus? So, Monica, what do you do? Aahh, I'm a... chef at a restaurant uptown. Good for you. Yeah it is, mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do. This hummus is great. God bless the chickpea. Oh, god, I am so spoiled... That's it! And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow? I used to wet my bed. I use my breasts to get other people's attention. We both do that! Monica and Rachel's apartment. Err yeh, aayah, yeh, just one second..... ah, Rachel, it's your dad. Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. li - listen, Dad, I ca n't talk right now, um, but there's something, um... there's something that I've been meaning to tell you... Would you excuse me for a second? Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Dreskin and I had sex on your bed. Daddy... Daddy... Daddy, why whyyy would I sleep with Billy Dreskin? His father tried to put you out of business!... dead! Ross, he's got the remote again. Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not. Hello? Um, yeah, uh, Okay ah, hold on a second, lem me lem me just check and see if see if Monica Geller's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Nurse says there's a problem with the form. Oh, god, oh god... Oh god, waddawe do, waddawe do, waddawe do? I do n't know! Why do n't you just explain? What do they want? Find out what they want!

Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh...... little playthings with yarn? What? Could you want Rachel Green more? Who? Dee, the sarcastic sister from What s Happening. Look, I am totally, totally over Rachel Green, OK, I just... : Hiiii! Hi! How are you? We're fine, we're fine. OK. Shut up! We're notwe're not saying anything. What? Uhhhh... Joey cried last night. Thank you. We were playing poker, alright... There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright? Oh, guys, you should've seen him.' Read' em and weep.' And then Joey Tribbiani did. Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us? Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play? No, women are welcome to play. Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it? There just do n't happen to be any women in our games. Yeah, we just do n't happen to know any women that know how to play poker. Oh, yeah, right. Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse! Really. I mean, that's a typical guy response. Excuse me, do any of you know how to play? No. But you could teach us. No. OK, so now we draw cards. So I would n't need any, right? Cause I have a straight. Oh, good for you! Congratulations! OK Phoebs, how many do you want? OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs. No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can'tyou ca n't do...

Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites. OOooooo! Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You ca n't serve food with more than one syllable. It's got ta be like chips, or dip, or pretz... OK, so at this point, the dealer... Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks... Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they did n't look happy... But... I'm ready, so, just deal. OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson. Joey... three... eight. Eight... three. Alright babe, deal the cards. Dammit, dammit, dammit! : Oh I see, so then, you were lying. About what? About how good your cards were. Heh... I was bluffing. A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying? OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Rach, Rach, we got ta settle. Settle what? The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so... The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game. Oh. Right. You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why do n't we just forget about the money, alright? Hell no, we'll pay! OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready. And you know what? We want a rematch. Well that's fine with me. Could use the money. : So basically, you get your ya - yas by taking money from all of your friends.... Yeah. Yes, and I get my ya - yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less. Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gon na play poker with me, do n't expect me to be a' nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt...... Yeah? I'm not a nice guy. Alright boys, let's eat. Oh, did you get that from the' I Love Rachel' pizzeria? You still on that? Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : \" When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy! \" You are way off, pal. No, I do n't think so, see Ross, because I think you love Rachel Green. Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for Rachel Green at one timenot any more. I justI... Marcel! Where are you going with that disc? You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OKif you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble. Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being? Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive. Ha. Ha, ha. What? Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black. Please! I am not as bad as Ross. Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident? That was not an incident! I - I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand. Oooooh. : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview! You're kidding! Where? Where? : Sak's... Fifth... Avenue. Oh, Rachel! Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home. Well, what's the job? Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living! OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since Aunt Iris was five. You got ta listen to every word she says. Hi! Is Tony Randall dead? No. I do n't think so. Why? Well, Tony Randall may be now, because I think I hit him with my car. What? Oh my God! Really? No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one. Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings. Thank y... Girls, sit down. Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it. Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else? Alright. I'm gon na pay for that tonight. Hi! Hey. Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what! Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident? Noooo... the interview! She loved me! Rachel's interviewer absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, andoh, I went to camp with her cousin... And, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well! That's great! That's wonderful! Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story... OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker. Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you do n't want to play, we completely understand. Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I do n't know... Pictionary? Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies? Yes, we should. I think we should. Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those? No, no, that s OK. Y'know, I think I'm gon na give it a go. Alright. Alright... So, Phoebs owes $ 7.50, Monica, you owe $ 10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones. But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we got ta play that at our regular game. Alright, here's my $ 7.50. But I think you should know that this money is cursed. What? Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it. That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break' em up with a movie. Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen... Mmm - hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever. Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon. So, you gals wan na hand over your money now? That way, we do n't have to go through the formality of actually playing. Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy. OK, we done with the chit - chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker? Hey you guys, look, the one - eyed jack follows me wherever I go. Right, OK, serious poker. Excuse me, where are you going? Uh... to the bathroom. Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wan na play poker? I want to go to the bathroom. Alright, well, I'm gon na order a pizza. Oh no - no - no - no - no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then. That's fine. I'll just have a Tic - Tac to hold me over. Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. Yes!.... or no. Alright. : Your money's mine, Green. Your fly is open, Geller.

Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gon na be the two of us, Rachel Green spent all day taking care of my monkey... I ca n't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey. Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo Rachel Green. Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used. Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven.

Which ones? Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything. Hey. Hi. Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative? Rachel lost Marcel. Oh no, how? He - he pooped in my shoe. Which one? Those cute little black ones I wear all the time. No, which one? The right or left?' Cause the left one is lucky... C'mon, you guys, what're we gon na do, what're we gon na do? Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go? Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gon na wan na do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room. Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gon na be home any minute! He's gon na kill me! Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth. Well, what'm I gon na do? What'm I gon na do? Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to kill you. Anybody wan na trade? Oh... Whaddyou want? Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it? I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it? No! Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall? I was n't ready for it. A monkey. Have you seen a monkey? Saw Regis Philbin once... Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. You owe me a waffle. Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...... with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks. Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today? Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine? Yeah. You, uh, you want some? Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wan na go to Newark? Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the murder capital of the North - East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff? Well - Oh God, Ross, I can not do this. Okay, quick and painful. Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please do n't hate me. Oh, what? What - what? Y'know Marcel?... Yeah? Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him. I - I - I ca - I ca n't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment. I know, I know, I'm sorry - No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil. Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I - Oh! Who is it? Animal Control. See? I've even called Animal Control! You called Animal Control? Uh-huh... why... do you not like them? Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me. O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that... That's right, I..'cause I did n't expect you were gon na invite them to the apartment! Hi, thanks for coming. Somebody called about a monkey? Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we - we did n't. Turned out it was a hat. Cat! Cat! What'm I saying? Cat! Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no - one's seen Marcel. Marcel? My uncle Marcel. Oh, is that who the monkey's named after? Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal? Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail? Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first? Yes, but there is n't always time! Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we have n't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller. Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green! Yeah! Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room! Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa! The Luisa from home room! Yes!! You have no idea who I am, do you. No, none at all. None. Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say' Morning, Luisa'? Or' Nice overalls'? Oh, I'm - I'm so sorry! Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems. But you? What a bitch! What?! Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats? I could... but I wo n't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. Dun - dun - duuuur! Sorry. Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Hi, can I help you? Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we - we were looking for something... A monkey. Yes have you seen any? No. No, have n't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators? Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way? Of course. Oh. Then, no. Did I put too much rum in here? Just a sec. Hope you find your monkey. Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu. Uh, are n't we kind of in the middle of something here? Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot. We ca n't, alright? We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out. Okay, from now on, you do n't get to talk to other people. Marcel? Marcel?! Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel? Oh - my - God! Whaaat! Something just brushed up against my right leg! What is it? Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg. Look, Phoebe! Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere! Step aside, ladies! What're you gon na do? Just a small tranquiliser. Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel! Are you okay? Yeah, think so. Oh! Huh. Whoah. Oh gosh. Marcel? Marcel? Marc - oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's - he's just gone. Ross, you do n't know that. Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he does n't know the Village. And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much. Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gon na break my foot, right here. Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?! Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I do n't miss Marcel any more! Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose. Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel - land, doing your Rachel - thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings... Ross. I do n't even wan na hear it, you're just... Ross. Oh, forget it, okay? Ross! What? What? Hey! Hey, Bananaman! Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea. Hi, did you order some bananas? What about it? Gim me back my monkey. I do n't have a monkey. Then what's with all the bananas? Potassium. Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel? Marcel! What've you done to him? That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey. Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. C'mere, Patti. C'mere, Marcel. C'mere, Patti. Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! Gotcha. Okay, gim me my monkey back. That's my monkey. You're both gon na have to take this up with the judge. That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever. Alright, I want my monkey. No! Oh, c'mon, Luisa! Sorry, prom queen. You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat. Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it! Nope. Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell Luisa's supervisor that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart? It'll be nice to get this off finally, wo n't it? Yes it will. Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine. Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit. Listen, I'm - I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I... Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your... Yeah, but you were the one who got Mr. Heckles back, y'know? You, you were great.... Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape? That'd be good. Alright. The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming. Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um... Rachel. Barry?! I ca n't. I ca n't do it, I ca n't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you. Oh! We have got to start locking that door! This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids? Nope. That's because I'm in front of them. Eh. I thought that was an alp. Well, high school was not my favourite time. I du n no, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex. Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice. Gosh, does n't it seem like a million years ago? Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh!

I would much rather be Mr. Peanut than Mr. Salty. No way! Mr. Salty is a sailor, all right, Mr. Salty's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is. I do n't know, you do n't wan na mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy. Oh my God. You guys! You got ta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope! I ca n't believe it! Man 1's looking right at us! Oh, that is so sick. I feel violated. And not in a good way. How can people do that?... Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots! I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we did n't have to play any games... So have you called her yet? Let her know I like Danielle? What are you, insane? It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem? I'm right, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle. I ca n't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people. Oh, God, just do it! Call her! Stop being so testosteroney! Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat. I got her machine. Danielle answer machine? No, interestingly enough Danielle leaf blower picked up. So, uh, why did n't you say anything? Oh, no - no - no - no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase \" Yes indeedy - o. \" Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, do n't everybody look at once! Okay, okay, what's going on? Okay, they're just talking... Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does Barry look like he was just told to shove anything? No, no actually, Barry's smiling.. and... Oh my God, do n't do that!! What? What? What?! That man across the street just kicked that pigeon! Oh! And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law. Oh!... Right! Hey Rach! How'd it go? Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. Barry took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out... Not a good day for birds... Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but Barry got me a little bottle of Chanel... That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm? Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see Barry again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice! That's, that's nice twice! Rachel, what's going on? I mean is n't this the same Barry who you left at the altar? Duh, where've you been? Yeah, but it was different with Barry today! And he was n't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that? Yes! Why? I have my reasons. Okay, how about the fact that Barry's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex-best friend? All right. All right, all right, all right, all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see Barry this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it! Wow... Wow! Yeah. I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that. Nooo, it was n't. Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here... Oh, Danielle! I was n't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance. Bye - bye. Oh God! That's what you've been working on for the past two hours?! Hey, I've been honing! What was with the dishes? Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I have n't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours. Look look! Man 1's doing it again, the guy with the telescope! Oh my God! Go away! Stop looking in here! Great, now Man 1's waving back. Man, we got ta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I ca n't do stuff! What kinda stuff? Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked. You cook naked? Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters. What are you looking at me for? I did n't know that. What's the matter? Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good. No, it was. It was very very good. Well, what about Mindy? Oh, way, way better than Mindy. No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy? Well, if you want, I'll justI'll just break it off with her. No. No - no - no - no, no. I mean, do n't do that. Not, I mean not for me. Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment. Thanks, Bernice. Let's go away this weekend. Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.. We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it. I had a bra. Hey, Dr. Farber. All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here. What?! I'm twelve, I'm not stupid. Can I use your phone? Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone. Yes, it's working! Why is n't she calling me back? Maybe Danielle never got your message. Y'know, if you want, you can call Danielle machine, and if Danielle has a lot of beeps, that means Danielle probably did n't get Danielle messages yet. Y'do n't think that makes me seem a little...... desperate, needy, pathetic? Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad. How many beeps? She answered. Y'see, this is where you'd use that' hello' word we talked about. I'm not gon na talk to her, Danielle obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy. Hey! Hi! How'd Barry take it? Pretty well, actually... Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair? Oh, do I? Uh huh. We ended up having sex in his chair. You had sex in his chair?!... I said that a little too loudly, did n't I? You - you had what? Sex in his chair. What, uh... what were you thinking? I do n't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there.' S'like you and Carol. No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol! Please. If she said to you, \" Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now, \" what would you say? If it helps, I could slide over. It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi - I got ta go. Where are you going? I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late - for keeping up with it. Okay? Hello? Hello? Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... Okay... Great... Great... All right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. Okay... Bye. Oh God. Oh God. Oh God. So how's Mindy? Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow... Oh, Mindy sounded really weird, I got ta call Barry... Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be! Brrrrrrr! Hell is filled with people like you. He's back! The peeper's back! Get down! Get down?... And boogie! Thanks, but I got ta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy. Relax. Y'know, Mindy may not even know. Please. I have n't heard from her in seven months, and now Mindy calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... Mindy taught me how to kiss.. Yeah? And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.... Naughty! Right, I'll see you guys later... Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or - That's fine, yeah... Okay, I'm gon na go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone? Why do n't you just take it with you? Hey, we have n't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee? Why do n't you just call her? I ca n't call Danielle, I left a message! I have some pride. Do you? No! Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I do n't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay. She's on the other line, Danielle's gon na call me back. She's on the other line, Danielle's gon na call me back, Danielle's on the other line, gon na call me back... Do n't you have to pee?' S'why I'm dancing... Mindy. Hey, you. Hey, you.... So, what's up? Um.. we should really be sitting for this. Sure we should... So. Now, I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world... Except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I do n't talk to anywhere,'cause she's all bitter now that Laurie Schaffer lost the weight and it turns out she does n't have a pretty face..... Okay, I'm just gon na ask you this once, and I want a straight answer. Okay. Will you be my maid of honour? Of course! Oh that's so great! Was that all you wanted to ask me? That's all! Ohhhh!!... What? What? That's not all. Oh sure it is! Oh no, it is n't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city. Um, what - what would make you think that? Well, ever since we announced the engagement, Barry's been acting really weird, and then last night, Barry came home smelling like Chanel. Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to Barry he went through a whole weird thing too. Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of! What? What's what you were afraid of? Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, Barry and I... kind of... had a little thing on the side. What? I know. I know, and when Barry proposed to me, everyone said \" Do n't do it, Barry's just gon na do to you what Barry did to Rachel, \" and now I feel so stupid. Uh... Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid. What do you mean? Smell familiar? Oh no. Oh, I am so sorry. No me, I am so sorry... Oh my. Four letters : \" Circle or hoop \". Ring dammit, ring! Thanks. Hey, you know our phone's not working? What?! I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer. I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off! Just like you told her you did!... Just pointing out the irony. Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman - I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone? Nngghhh!!!!!!! Can I use your phone? Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please. \" Heating device. \" Radiator. Five letters. Rdtor. Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is? Sidney's a woman. So she's a woman! So what? Yeah. Yeah, so what? Look, I live across the street, and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I do n't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wan na walk around my apartment in my underwear, I should n't have to feel like Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... Mostly free weights, but occasionally.. Joey!! Yeah, my neighbor... Yeah, the brunette... She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress. The green dress? Really? Yeah, Sidney Marks said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day. Nooo! Hey. Got a second? Sure, sure. Come on...... in... Hello, sweetheart. Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here? Uh, we are here to break up with you. Both of you? Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you. I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I could n't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much! Uh - which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?.... Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy. Even when we were having sex in that chair? I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you. Please! During that second time you could n't have picked her out of a lineup! You did it twice? Well, the first time did n't really count... I mean, y'know,' s'Barry. Okay... Sweetheart, just gim me - gim me another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba. Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here... Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer. Oh God... I'll be right there, Bernice. Look, please, please do n't go anywhere, okay? I'll be, I'll be right back. Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels great. Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gon na marry him. What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock! Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wan na be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S. Oh God. I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honor...? And I hope Barry does n't kill you and eat you in Aruba. You okay? Yeah. Really? Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know. Aww... Big day. All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat... You know he's gay? I just wan na clarify this : are you outing Mr. Peanut? Chandler? Danielle! Hi! Uh - everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay.... I'm, I'm okay. Listen uh, maybe we could get together later? That sounds good. I'll call you - or you call me, whatever... You got it. Okay. G'bye, everybody. Bye. Whoo - hoo! Yeah, there you go! Second date!... I du n no. You do n't know?! Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that? \n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Danielle: [Danielle, Danielle]\n","None\n","Danielle: [Danielle,

I have no idea. But look how much they spent! Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought. I know. It's just such reckless spending. I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind. Wow, what a geek. They spent $ 69.95 on a Wonder Mop. That's me. Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back - come here, Marcel - Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him. Ross, you've got to do something about the humping. What? It's, it's just a phase. Well, that's what we said about Joey... Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal. Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey! What? Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious. Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing. This woman's living my life. What? Woman 1's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. Woman 1 buys tickets for plays that I wan na see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. Woman 1 spent three hundred dollars on art supplies. You're not an artist. Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I do n't. Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things. Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we. Oh, it's so late for' Shall we'... Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School? Nooo... This is so unfair! Woman 1's got everything I want, and she does n't have my mother. How about Joey... Pepponi? No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral. Joey... Switzerland? Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I du n no, this big. Which I'm not. Joe... Joe... Joe... Stalin? Stalin... Stalin... do I know that name? It sounds familiar. Well, it does not ring a bell with me... Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good. Might wan na try Joseph. Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that! Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were. What are you doing? Alright, great. Thanks a lot. I'm going to tap class. What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card? This woman's got my life, I should get to see who Fake Monica is. Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up!... Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing. This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, for the love of God, Monica, do n't do it!!... Thank you. What d'you think? Lotsa things. Which one do you think Woman 1 is? May I help you? Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe. You do n't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there. What does she mean? I think Teacher means' You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me? People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again! She could be you. Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight... Okay, I'm not getting this! I'm totally getting it! Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated? What? You just click when they click. Alright people, now everyone grab a partner. Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel. Great. It's gym class all over again. Aww. Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me. Why do n't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl? She's your partner. Hi. I'm Monica. Oh. Monica!... Hi. I'm Mo -... nana. Monana? Yeah. It's Dutch. You're kidding! I - I spent three years in Amsterdam. Um, Pennsylvania Dutch. And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight... Hi. Hey. Where've you been? At the vet. Woman's not gon na make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is Woman? Woman says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity. Hey! He beat ya. Woman 1 says as time goes on, he's gon na start getting agressive and violent. So what does this mean? I'm gon na have to give him up. I ca n't believe it, Ross. This sucks! I do n't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already? I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I ca n't get off my leg. Is n't there any way you can keep him? No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin,' he's just gon na get vicious. I've just got ta get him into a zoo. How do you get a monkey into a zoo? I know that one!... No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen. Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo. Hey. We found Woman, we found the girl. What? Did you call the cops? Nope. We took her to lunch. Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. Woman stole. Woman's a stealer. Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, Woman is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader.... Take off their hats! Popes in a Volkswagen!... I love that joke. No way. No way did you do this. Monana was very brave. It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...... They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I do n't know. Do n't wait up. Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.' Scuse me? There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say? Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I - I ca n't even stand in front of a tap class. Well, that's just probably'cause of your Amish background. What? Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. I - I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society? Uh-huh. I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he ca n't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought,' Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. Oh God. We did n't get into Scranton. That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I do n't know who this is harder on, me or him. I'd say that chair's taking the brunt. Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him? Oh, somebody will. You know there already is a Joseph Stalin? You're kidding. Apparently Joseph Stalin was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that! Y'know, you'd think I would've. Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?... Flame Boy. Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? Yes. Does he, uh, fight with other animals? No - no, he's, he's very docile. Even if he were... cornered? Well I, I do n't know. Why? Uh, how is he at handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what cha mean... How about a hammer, or a small blade? Why - why - why would he need a blade? Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. He - he - he got in, he - he got in to San Diego. We, we come back from our walk and the - the phone was ringing...... He's in. He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. Yo - hooo! Where the hell've you been? Monica and I just crashed an embassy party. Are you drunk?! Noooo! I'm lying. I am so drunk. Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried... Monica? Monica! Water rules! Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wan na know if you're gon na be showing up for work? Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today. Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gon na lose your job! This is not you! No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm - I'm Monana! Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people. Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks. What? They've arrested Monica. Hi. Hey. How are you? I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How - how did you know I was here? Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using. That I was not expecting. I want you to know, it was n't me who turned you in. Oh. Thanks. No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it was n't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theater! Well, actually, you only got to sing' Memo -'. I just ca n't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gon na do without you? Who's gon na crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gon na take me to the Big Apple Circus? Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty - five other women, and you're worried about who's gon na take you to the Big Apple Circus? Well, not... worried, just... wondering. There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gon na go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are. Not necessarily... Yes necessarily! I mean, I du n no what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing. Um, I'm not actually Amish. Really? Then why are you like that? You by the door. In or out? In. You in the back, you're getting it all wrong! Yeah, but at least I'm doing it! This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A. Okay. Good - bye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but do n't eat it' till you get on the plane. Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe. Oh! Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gon na be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn. I du n no what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey. Just, just say what you feel. Marcel, I'm hungry. That was good. Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the plane. Uh, if you guys do n't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him. Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. Marcel, c'mere, c'mere. Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gon na miss you, and I'm never gon na forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be - Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would - okay, just take him away. Just take him. Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek... That's fine, thank you. Next.

No. Tell Chandler Bing, tell Chandler Bing. Just... please tell him. Shut up! Tell me what? Look at you, you wo n't even look at Chandler Bing. Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women wo n't look at me. All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were... Doing it on this table. Wow! Exellent dream score. Why, why, why would you dream that? More importantly, was I any good? Well, you were pretty damn good. Interesting, cause in my dreams, I'm allways surprisingly inadequate. Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table. I love it, when we share. You're okay there? I ca n't belive you two had sex in Rachel Green dream. I'm sorry, it was a one - time - thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious. Hello Rachel. Get off. Uh, uh, gim me. Can you see me operating a drill press? I do n't know. What are you wearing? Pheebs, why would you want to operate a drill press? Just for some short - term - work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients. Pirates again? No, nothing like that. I was just... such a dummie. I taught this \" massage - yourself - at - home - workshop. \" And they are. Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you. Thanks Joey, that's a good idea. What... I could, I could do it. What is it? Well, my secretary is gon na be out for a couple of weeks. Chandler's secretary is having one of her boobs redused. It's a whole big boob story. I could be a secretary. Well, you know Phoebs. I do n't know if it's your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day. I could do that. What are you playing with? Oh, it's my new beeper. What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for? Is it like for dinosaur emergencies.' Help, come quick, they're still extinct.' No, it's for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all Carol Willick has to do is to dial 55 - JIMBO. A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid. All right, I'll see you guys later. Off to see young Ethan? Thank you. How young is young Ethan? Young? Young Ethan's... our age. When we were? Okay, Young Ethan's a senior in college. College? Whoa! And this manchild has no problem with how old you are? No, of course not. It's not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22. What? Oh, I ca n't pass for 22? Well, maybe 25 - 26. I am 26. There you go. Can you hear that? Yeah? See that'll stop when you pick up the phone. Oh. Uh, I'm on. Mr. Bing's office. No I'm sorry, he's in a meeting right now. I'm not in a meeting. I'm right... Whoops. Will Chandler Bing know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, I'll see that Chandler Bing gets the message. Bye bye. What? Ross says hi. Ah! This is so fun. All right, what do we do now? Well, now, I actually have to get to work. Most likely. Okay, I'm gon na be out there. Okay. All right. Bye bye. Bye bye. Yes? What cha doin'? Ooh. Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, belt's to tight, got ta change the belt. Did I turn the fish? No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control? Just a touch. Mon, I do n't understand. I mean, you've been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh. What? Could tonight be the Night? I do n't know. Look Young Ethan's a great guy and I love being with Young Ethan but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You do n't plan these things. So, did you shave your legs? Yeah. A-ha! Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It does n't mean... Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god it's baby time. Baby time. All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool. Yeah, hi, I was just beeped. No, Andr is not here. Third time today. Yes, I'm sure... No, sir. I do n't perform those kind of services. Services? Oh, services. Yeah, you want 55 - JUMBO. Yeah, that's right. That's right, JUMBO with a U, sir. No, belive me, you do n't want me. Judging by his number, I'd be a huge disappointment. All rightie, bye bye. Hey, hey. How was the first day? Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice. See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes. Me. No, I did n't tell anybody that I knew you. Why not? Oh, because, you know... they do n't like you. What?! I thought you knew that. Noho. Who does n't they like me? Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone. What are you talking about? Do n't feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now you're like \" Mr. Boss Man \". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, \" Boss Man Bing \". I ca n't belive it. Yeah, yeah. They even do you. They do me? You know like... uh okay... uh...' Could that report be any later?' I do n't sound like that. Oh, oh Chandler... Oh... Yeah, you do.' The hills were alive with the sound of music.' My scones.' My scones.' Okay, I do n't sound like that. That is so not true. That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up! Did not. I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that gunpoint was an actual place where crimes happen. How was that possible? Well, think about it. It's always on the news.' A man is being held up, at gunpoint.'' Tourists are being terrorised, at gunpoint.' And I just kept thinking : why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go. Okay. Okay. Unless... What? Uh, ah. Unless you wan na stay over? I mean, I'm going to, so... Yeah, I'd really like that. Uuh, before we get into any staying - over - stuff, there is something you should know. Okay, is this like' I have an early class tomorrow' or' I'm secretly married to a goat?' Well it's somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, I'm not uh..., well I, I mean I have n't ever uh... Ethan? Yeah? Are you a virgin? Well, if that's what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, I've kinda been waiting for the right person. Really? Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right? Wow! You keep saying that. You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practice it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that. Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I - I figured if you could be honest, then I can to. Oh god, do n't tell me, I did it wrong. No - no. Nothing wrong about that. Oh. Um, okay, here it goes. I'm not 22. I'm, I'm 25... and thirteen months. Huh! But I figured, you know, that should n't change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are. Uh, listen um, as long as we're telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. I'm a little younger than I said. You're not a senior? Oh, I'm a senior... in High School. Ok... ay. What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that was n't alive during the Bicentennial. I just had sex. Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me? Well, you never told me how old you were. Well, that's different. My lie did n't make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking? I was n't thinking. I was too busy fallin'... Do n't say it.... in love with you. Really? Sorry. Well, fall out of it. You know, you should n't even be here, it's a school night. Oh god, oh god. I'm like those women that you see with shiny guys named Chad. I'm Joan Collins. Who? Okay, Andr should be there in like 45 minutes. All rightie, bye bye. Just easier that way. Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream. No, forget it. Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy? All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there. Joey was there too. All right. Was there... uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there. No. You're sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything? No, it was just the three of us. Huh! So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler? You know what? What? There were times when it was n't even me. That is so sweet, you guys. Hey, Mon. Mon, Ethan called again. Mon? Mon! What? Ethan called again. Oh. Are you not seeing him anymore? No. You know, sometimes just things does n't work out. And this has nothing to do with the fact that Young Ethan needs a note to get out of gym. I, I did n't say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear. Young Ethan stopped by. Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask Young Ethan which one the strongest Power Ranger is? Oh, yeah. Ha, ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now? Sorry. It's morphin time! Stegosaurus! Tyrannosaurus! Ooh, oh, I've got ta go. Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go. Cool! Where are you going? Um, oh, I've got a birthday party, with some work people. Work people? Nobody told me. No, I know. That's a part of the whole, you know, them - not - liking - you - extravaganza. You know, I do n't get this. A month ago, these people were my friends. You know, just because I'm in charge does n't mean I'm a different person. Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are. You think I should? I really do, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, but, could we not go together? I, I do n't wan na be the geek that invited the boss. I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing Ebony and Ivory. You were great. But they still made fun of you. What? You know, now you're more like, you know like, \" Mr. Caring Boss, \" \" Mr. \", you know, \" I'm one of you, Boss, \" \" Mr., I wan na be your buddy, Boss Man Bing! \" Then, I do n't get it. Well, you know what Chandler? I think you've got ta face it. You're like, the guy in the big office, you know. You're the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say you're a great boss. They do? Uh huh. But they're not your friends anymore. I just wa n't to... No, but you ca n't. But I just wa... Uh uh. Are n't you gon na... Oh, Carol and I have a new system. If Carol Willick punches in 911, it means Carol Willick's having a baby, otherwise I just ignore it. What about Andre? Oh, well this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know. Hey. That was gon na be my opener. Hey, did you guys check out those new hand - dryers in the bathroom? I thought that was just a rumour. True story. They're here already? All right, look. I've got ta tell you something. I'm not 17. I only said so that you'd think I was cute and vunerable. I'm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, I'm your Congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, we're great together. We can talk, we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great. It was. Then, what's the problem? Ethan, it's um... it's icky. Icky? You're actually gon na throw this away because it's icky? This is n't easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really... No, do n't say it.... love you. Are you're hands still wet? Uh, moist, yeah.

You're gon na kill me! 15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12... Count faster. It's gon na be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie. Who the hell is Jordie? Your son. No - no - no. I do n't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie. Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie. What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco. Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp. I got it. I got it. I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps. No, you do n't. All right, that's it. I want both of you out. Why? Ross Geller started it! No, you started it. You did! I do n't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier. But... Now go! Thanks a lot. See what you did. Yeah, listen... Out! Breathe, breathe, breathe... Oh, no. Ew! What is that? Something exploded! It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you? Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking? Breathe, breathe, breathe. Please. This is so your fault. How, how is this my fault? Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along. Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along. You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady? You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me. Oh, I'm threatened by you? Yes. Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I do n't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it! Yeah, Susan. Do n't make me do this again, I do n't like my voice like this. Ok, who wants to hear something ironic? Help! I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back. Ow. Are they here yet? No, honey, they're not, but do n't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok? Ok. Ok? Ok. Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating. It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel. There you go, dear. Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push' em out, push' em out, harder, harder. Push' em out, push' em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's I was justyeah, right. Push! Push! What're you gon na do, suck the door open? Help! Help! They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la. Help! Now, Mom, everything's going fine, really. Yeah, Ross is great. Ross Geller's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you do n't have to fly back, really. What do you mean this might be your only chance? Would you stop? I'm only 26, I'm not even thinking about babies yet. Where have you been? Oh, just had a baby. Mazel tov! I do n't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone? No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you? No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me. Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors. No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do. Oh. I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh... Well, for instance, what do you do? I'm a waitress. Ok, all right, well are n't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like,' if I see one more cup of coffee'... Yeah. Gotcha. I'm gon na go check up on your friend. Ok. That's fine. So how did you know I was even here? Your mom called me. So is this Lydia's mom? No, this is a loaner. I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself. I was n't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy. So, did you see who won the game? Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck. Yeah, they're not so bad. Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit. This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you. The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have. No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me? You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day. Every day is Lesbian Lover Day. This is so great. You wan na explain that? I mean, well,'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world. I'm sorry, you were fighting. Where are they? I'm sure they'll be here soon. Yeah, honey, they would n't miss this. Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station. You are really frightening me. Somebody wan na help me, tryin' to rip out my heart. Uh, that's great. Anybody seen a nipple? All right, ten centimeters, here we go. All right, honey, time to start pushing. But they're not here yet! I'm sorry, I ca n't tell the baby to wait for them. Oh, god. Ok, got the vent open. Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue! Ben, you ready? All right, gim me your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben. What do you see? Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent. Phoebs, It's open! It's open! Wait! You forgot your legs! Push, push! We're here! Where have you been? Long story, honey. All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need Excuse me, could I have this? All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go! Good luck! Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner? Out! All right, he's crowning. Here he comes. Let me see, I got ta see, I got ta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this? Not.... helping! You're doing great, you're doing fine. Hello! Oh, sorry. What do you see? What do you see? We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person. Oh, look at that. What does he look like? Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jell - o. Really? You guys, he's beautiful! Oh, thanks, Pheebs! No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy. How' bout Ben? I like Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before? We uh, we just cooked it up. That's what we were off doing. Hi. Hey. Can we come in? I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody. Susan, he looks just like you. Thanks. Oh, god, I ca n't believe one of us actually has one of these. I know, I still am one of these. Ross, can I? The head, the head. You got ta... Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I... I will always have gum. Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes I may be away longer, like this. But I'll still always come back, like this. And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this. He is so amazing. Oh, I know. Look at him. Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I do n't think that's his name. Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes. Look, he's opening his eyes. He does n't do much, does he? No, this is pretty much it. You guys wan na get some coffee? Yeah. All right, I'll see you guys later. Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again. \n","Carol Willick's: [Carol Willick's, Carol Willick's, Carol Willick's, she, Carol Willick, Carol Willick, Carol Willick, She, Carol Willick, Carol

Pardon? Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back. Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars. I will, really. I'll pay you back this time.... And where's this money coming from? Well... I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research. What kind of research? Oh, just, y'know.... science. Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.... It's a fertility study. Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time. Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. Hey. Wow, ooh, you're gon na be making money hand over fist! OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns... We've got the ground - up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... Men are here. We make fire. Cook meat. Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back. Ewww! Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gon na be late. Oh, OK. So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your special someone? I do n't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great. Yeah? What does she think of your little science project? What, you think I'm gon na tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup? Man's got a point. Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me. Crazy bitch. Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean. Joey... we always know what you mean. Hey. Hey. Hey. How long did you think this barbecue was gon na last? I'm going to China. Jeez, you say one thing, and... You're going to China? Yeah, i - it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they do n't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the boit'sit's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gon na be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wan na reach me, y - you ca n't. So here's my itinerary. Um... here's a picture of me... Oh, let me see! : Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he does n't forget me? Yeah. Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh.... Alright, this barbecue is gon na be very fun. Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left. Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl. Oh. Hey, who's Carl? You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse. No. Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the... At the coffeehouse, right. So you do know who he is! Sorry. OK, I'm gon na go say goodbye to the guys. Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story. Hi. Hey! Hey!.... I have to go to China. The country? No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is? Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no. Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight. Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!? Forget about her. He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food. Course there, they just call it food. Yeah... I guess. I don'tI do n't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you. I know. We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice. Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves' The Three Basketeers.' Like the three musketeers, only with fruit. Ooooh. OK, how does everybody like their burgers? Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up? Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gon na... complete the transaction, if you know what I... Then you do. Heh, heh. So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her? What do you mean? Y'know, just be there for her. Not following you. Think about it. OK, I'm guessing this is from... Well, thank you, Melanie. OK, this one right here is from me. OK... ah, it's light...... it rattles... it's... Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And...... it's a book! Oh, it's Dr. Seuss! : That book got me through some tough times. There is a little child inside this man! Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die. Who's this from? Oh, that's Ross's. Oh...... Oh my God. He remembered. Remembered what? It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I ca n't believe he remembered! Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune. I ca n't believe he did this. Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck? What did you just say? ahem... um... Crystal duck. No, no, no.... the, um, the...' love' part? F - hah.... flennin.... Oh.... my God. Oh, no - no - no - no - no.... That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time. I mean, this is unbelievable. I know. This is really, really huge. No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. Nuh - uh. I do n't think any of our lives are ever gon na be the same ever again. OK, is there a mute button on this woman? I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D - did you have any idea? No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W - well, what else did Ross Geller say? I mean, does Ross Geller, like, want to go out with me? Well, given that Ross Geller's desperately in love with you, he probably would n't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to Ross Geller. H - Ross Geller's in China! The country. No, no, wait. His flight does n't leave for another forty - five more minutes. What about the time difference? From here to the airport? Yes! You're never gon na make it! Rachel, what're you gon na say to Ross Geller? I-I-I do n't know. Well then maybe you should n't go. He's right, cause if you're just gon na, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now. I do n't know. Maybe I'll know when I see Ross Geller. Here, look, alright, does this help? Noooo... look, all I know is that I can not wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just got ta talk to Ross Geller. I... I got ta... OK, I'll see you later. Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! Alright! Ni - chou chi - ma! Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... Hi! Hi. May I see your boarding pass? Oh, no, no, I do n't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. No, I know, but Ihe just went on. He's right there, Ross Geller's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j - just... No no no! Federal regulations! OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give Ross Geller a message for me? Please? This is very important. Alright. What's the message? Uh... I do n't know. Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you. What? It's from Rachel. She said that Rachel Green loved the present, and Rachel Green will see you when you get back. : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I do n't know what Flight Attendant's talking about! There's no Rachel! Do n't give me that deep freeze. Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute! Heh, heh. It was nothin'. Well, now we've got ta find something fun for you! Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn. M - Me again? Sure! Why not? Boy, somebody's gon na get a big fruit basket tomorrow. Oooh, I got ta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be. How do you mean? I do n't know, I - I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always' me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman. Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wan na save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gon na go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out? I do n't know. I do n't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. Sure. I do n't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great. Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends - in - law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about Ross Geller! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. Another good point. No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed. Huh? Well, I mean, then what happens if it does n't work out? Why is n't it working out? I do n't know... sometimes it does n't. Is Ross Geller not cute enough for you? No! Does Ross Geller not make enough money? No, I'm just.... Maybe there's someone else. Wha... Is there? Is there someone else? No! There is.. there is noone else! Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? Hey, big... Shhhh!... spender. She's still asleep. So how'd it go? Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. Well, it's like, last night, I could n't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. It was amazing! And not just for Melanie... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. I did n't know you had another level. I know! Neither did I! Hey, great skirt! Birthday present? Yeah. Oh, from who? From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me. Well, it's the thought. Hey, does n't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27 - B? Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea. Oh, why? Because, I feel like I would n't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I do n't wan na... No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... I am not' so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise. Who is it? It's me, Carl. C'mon up. Behind my brother's back?... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you wo n't be hearing from me. Seven hundred bucks! Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. Really? So, you're gon na stick with this' it's all for her' thing? What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gon na shoot myself! I mean, do n't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy! I ca n't believe you'd rather go out with him than me. Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here. Fine, just stop thinking about me. Ca n't do it, can you? So I'm thinking about you. So what? I do n't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway? Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy.... I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car! Rachel, come on. Give us a chance. Ross, it's too hard. No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I - I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade. Ross, you're like my best friend. I know. If we broke up, and I lost you... Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gon na break up? Well, have you been involved with someone where you have n't broken up? No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me? I do n't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before. Well, start looking. Wow. Exactly! And you just know I'm gon na be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic! Right! You're right! Heh... y'know? You know what? What? I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do.... I meanI'm sorry. I-I-I got ta go. I'm sorry. But... Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi. For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel! Oh, hey, hey, I got that. Oh, thanks, sweetie. No problem. I can not wait for you to meet my friends. Really? Yeah. You do n't think they'll judge and ridicule me? No, no, they will. I just... uh... Ca n't wait.

Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell Rachel Green, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \" forget about her \" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \" Oh my god. \" So she went to the airport to meet Ross Geller when he came back, but what Rachel Green did n't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been? Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! Rach! Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? It was, it was great. Oh, what happened? What? You're bleeding. I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wan na hear everything! Everything. Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel. These are, these are n't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country. Thank you. I'm from New York. Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. No way! I'm telling you, Rachel Green went to the airport, and Rachel Green's gon na go for it with Ross! Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? Um, this? Yes. Guys, you got your hair cut. Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.' Cause, you know, if you do n't look good, we do n't look good. I love that voice. Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around Julie. Cramp, cramp. Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs. You, you, you said Ross Geller liked me. You, you slowpokes! That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up? What up?! Everyone, this is Julie. Julie. Ohh. Hi! Hi, but I'm not here, you have n't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I do n't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. And bus. Oh my god. The screaming guy? And the spitting? You got ta hear this story. We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old... 200 at least.... and this guy... And the chicken pooped in Julie lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, did n't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about. This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen? Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. But we have n't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. Julie! Julie, is n't that great? I mean, is n't that just kick - you - in - the - crotch, spit - on - your - neck fantastic? It's an expression. Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gon na go see the baby. And then we've got ta get some sleep. Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time. Well, listen, do n't tell us what's gon na happen though,'cause I like to be surprised. Bye. Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Hey, Rach, can I get... Did you talk to him? Not yet. Then, no. So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gon na happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? God? It was you, pal. Well, maybe it was God, doing me. Look, you were right. Rachel Green looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I do n't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it had n't been for you. Well, you owe me one, big guy. Here's your lemonade. I did n't order lemonade. Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gon na charge you for that. But... Go - go - go - go, come on! So uh, what did you find out? He said... he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wan na see it, is that Ross Geller made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever. How is that the silver lining? You have to really wan na see it. Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking? Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? No, although now that's what I'm thinking. All right, so what were you thinking? Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? Ohh! No. Why not? Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak. No you're not. I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. Hello? Hi. Hi. Anybody know a good tailor? Needs some clothes altered? No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk. Why do n't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. Frankie did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No,' scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990? Okay. You have to stop the Q - tip when there's resistance! Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you did n't hang up either. She did n't hang up either! Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y... Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. Rachel! I'll just call her back. Okay! Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected... Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I ca n't have. Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too. I know you did. I'm just gon na deal with it, I'm just gon na deal with it. I got ta get out of here. Ok, I do n't care what you guys say, something's bothering Rachel Green. You know, I think I was sixteen. Please, just a little bit off the back. I'm still on \" no. \" Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec? No - no - no - no - no, I'm not fallin' for that again. What's goin' on? Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night. What stupid thing did you do? Bon giorno tutti! Ewww! Ok, Paulo, why do n't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye - bye. Rachel, how did this happen? I do n't know, I just kinda ran into Paulo last night. Where? At his apartment. Is this juice? Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped Paulo because he hit on Phoebe? Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser. Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. People do stupid things when they're upset. My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I had n't..., but this is about your horrible mistake. Hi! Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching. Hey, hey Ross. Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here? I do Raquel. So, uh, Paulo's back. Yeah, Paulo's back. Is that a problem? No, not a problem. Good! I'm glad it's not a problem. Ok, you're gon na have to not touch my ass. Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered. Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell Frankie Joey Tribbiani says hello. Frankie'll know what it means. Are you sure Frankie's gon na be able to crack that code? You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control - y and bossy and Monica about it. I promise. All right. Now some of you are gon na get cut, and some of you are n't. But I promise none of you are gon na feel a thing. All right, that's it, I quit. What? I did n't say anything. Yeah, but this is n't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, does n't trust a person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how Dudley Moore wears it. How who wears it? Demi Moore. Demi Moore is not a he. Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten. That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore. Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore? Demi Moore's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost! Oh, Demi Moore's got gorgeous hair. I know! How long do you want the cuffs? At least as long as I have the pants. I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam. How is she? It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign. How's the hair? I'm not gon na lie to you, Ross, it does n't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling. Can we see her? Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why do n't you come on in. Yeah. How're you doing? I'm okay. Ooh, that bad, huh? What? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts. When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, 50 feet of crap, then me. You got ta tell Ross how you feel. Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie? What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years. I do n't know, I do n't know. Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you. Yo, paisan! Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man! Frankie? What're you talking about? Hey, what's goin' on? Joey's tailor... took advantage of me. What? No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years. Oh come on! He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite... What? Cupping. That's how they do pants! First they go up one side, they move it over, then they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Is n't that how they measure pants? Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you? What? That's not? Oh my God. Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better. I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten. Thank you. My hair is very amused. Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true. Thank you. Well, I got ta go. Bye. Bye, Rach. Wait, are you leaving? Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by \" bye! \" Well, can I talk to you for a sec? Okay. Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test... That's ok. What's goin' on? Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I would n't. Um, second of all, what? Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot? No. No - no - no - no. Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I mean I actuallyI - I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. Really? You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking \" Oh my god, I'm with Rachel \". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all? No, I think that was the whole all. Okay. Okay. Okay. I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants. I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andie McDowell's new haircut? Oh yeah! Oh, I can do that. Really? You wan na do it right now? Great! Ok, I just wan na be really sure this time. Andie McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right? No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andie McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes. Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you.

in like, 20 minutes, but I could n't resist. Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for Ben? Oh, is Ben hungry already? I guess so. You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. I got ta get one, too. What are you guys doing? We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world. Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gon na happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. Carol? Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast - feeding? Sure. Uh, does it hurt? It did at first, but not anymore. Chandler? So, uh, how often can you do it? As much as he needs. Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if Ben blows into one, does the other one get bigger? Rachel, do you have any muffins left? Yeah, I forget which ones. Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? No thanks. Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. Thank you. What a bitch. Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and Julie's friend wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it? I ca n't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet. Ok, um, I'll go with you. Great. Hi, honey. Hey, sweetums. Hello to the rest. Hi! Monica what're you doin'? You ca n't go shopping with Julie? What about Rachel? It's gon na be a problem, is n't it? Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in Rachel Green house of worship. But I'm... Monica, Rachel Green will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow? Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal. It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. Woof, woof. Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle. Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy? Who? Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man. Hombre? What's he doin' in my section? I guess Hombre Man does n't know. Well, Hombre Man's gon na. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'? Mornin'. Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory. Your territory, huh? Yeah. Bijan for men? No thanks. Hombre? Yeah. All right. You were saying? Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day. What? We were shopping, and we had lunch. Oh, all right. What did I have? You had a salad. Oh, no wonder I do n't feel full. Hey, guys, what's up. I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad. Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy? Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur. You went shopping for fur? Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs. You bought boobs? Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras. Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for... Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work you and I could go maybe grab a cup of coffee. Oh, actually I sorta have plans. Ready, Annabelle? You bet. Maybe some other time? Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men? Bijan for men?! Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he wo n't sleep. Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. Honey, relax. Ross is great with Ben. Do n't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. Oh, this is so cute. Oh, I got that for him. My mommies love me. That's clever. Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. Did you just say Hi, Jew? Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, Eddie Moskowitz likes it. Reaffirms his faith. Ben, dinner! Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you did n't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that. Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk. So? Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person. What is the big deal? What did you just do? Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? You wo n't even taste it? No! Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. Hey, where is everybody? They took Ben to the park. Where've you been? Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket. Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Okay. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars? You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card. And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket? That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent. Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with? Judy. Who? Julie. What?! Jody! You were with Julie? Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to Julie because Julie was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were... shopping. Oh. Oh my God. Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did n't mean anything to me. Yeah, right. Sure! Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out! Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. That is not true! Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with Julie to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I do n't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. Hey! How did we do? Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. I did not freak out. Why'd you freak out? Because it's breast milk. It's gross. My breast milk is gross? This should be fun. No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just do n't think breast milk is for adults. Of course the packaging does appeal to grown - ups and kids alike. Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. That would be no. Come on. It does n't taste bad. Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. You've tasted it? You've tasted it. Uh huh. Oh, you've tasted it. You can keep saying it, but it wo n't stop being true. Gim me the bottle. Gim me the towel. Howdy. Gim me a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wan na put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This is n't supposed to mean anything to you. I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I do n't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gon na come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gon na run? Yeah I guess you're right. You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. I'm gon na do it. All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and Miss Kitty'll fix you up with a nice hooker. I do n't know what else to say. Well that works out good, because I'm not listening. I feel terrible, I really do. Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife? Rachel, say that I'm friends with Julie, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible? Yes. It's that terrible? Yes. Monica, you do n't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, Julie's actually, but now she's actually stealing you. Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with Julie does n't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my... We're, we're... Oh, I love you. I love you too. You guys, um I know that this really does n't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that. Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she did n't do anything wrong. I mean, Julie was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave Julie a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me? I'd do anything for you, you know that. I'd do anything for you. Wait, wait, wait, wait! Mornin'. I said, mornin'. I heard ya. All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready? Ready. Yeah, I'm ready. You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing! Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do? I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. My god, what happened? These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all... stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now? Sure. So. So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right? I know, I probably should n't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you. Really? Me? Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you do n't. Well, you're not totally paranoid. Oy. Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gon na bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right. Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something? Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it. I'd love it too. Shoot, I got ta go. So, I'll talk to you later. All right, Julie. Bye. Bye. What a manipulative bitch.

This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I got ta go, I got ta go, I got ta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gon na get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy. Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh. It's open you guys. Hi. Hi, hi can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does Phoebe Buffay still live here? Uh, no Phoebe Buffay does n't but I can, I can get a message to Phoebe Buffay. Great. Uhh, just tell Phoebe Buffay her husband stopped by. What? Hey, how, how did you do that? This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married? Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and Duncan's gay and he's just from Canada and Duncan just needed a green card. I ca n't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything. I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve. Of course I would n't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? You see, and you thought Monica Geller'd be judgemental. OK, I was n't in love with Duncan and I was just helping out a friend. Please, when Duncan left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. Huuh. Well, did n't you? I might have. I ca n't believe you did n't tell me. Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. What have I not told you? Oh, I do n't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace. What! Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat. I did n't know it was a big secret. Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I do n't know, having a third nipple. You have a third nipple? You bitch. Whip it out, whip it out. C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless. Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? I ca n't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? I do n't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. Joey was in a porno movie. Huuh. If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me. You were in a porno? Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I could n't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but ca n't'cause there's people havin' sex on it. That is wild. So what's it shaped like? Yeah, is there a hair on it? What happens if you flick it? So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia. You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you do n't know? Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special. Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But Ross Geller's with her now and you're just gon na have to get over it. Ohh, I'm gon na have to get over it. God, see I did n't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it. Woah. Foxy lady. Where you goin'? Um, I'm gon na go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades. The Ice Capades? No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns are n't as fast but when Snoopy falls... funny. I ca n't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again. OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha... OK sweetie, I'll see you later. See you later Rach. Bye - bye Julie. Hey. Hey. Hey, c'mon, cut it out. Hey? What? Can I ask you somethin'? Sure. Naa. What? C'mon, talk to me. OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex? Why? Who's not having... Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? Technically, huh, no. Wow. Is it, is it'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it'cause Julie's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? No, no, Julie's great and it's not like we have n't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh... No, no no no, do n't need to know the details. It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I... Well, you just must think I'm weird. No, no, no, no I do n't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? What? I think it's sexy. Sexy? Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. No kidding? Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? What? I'd wait. You'd wait? Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait... then I'd wait some more. Really? Oh yeah, I do n't care how much she tells you Julie wants it, I do n't care if begs, Julie pleads, she tells you Julie, Julie's gon na have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. Women really want this? More than jewelry. Hi. Phoebe! Ta - da. Hey. Hi. Ahh, look at you, you look great. Do I? Thank you, so do you. Thanks. Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice. You always said I'd make it. Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo. I missed you. I'm gon na get changed. OK. Um, now. Phoebs. Oh, right, OK. Ole. What? Um, the matador. Ole, ha ha ha. Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. Uh, Julie. Yeah? Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. Hi everyone. Hi. I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. Oh, God, no problem. So you're gon na go with the uh, waiting thing? Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. What did, what did Joey Tribbiani say? Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what Joey Tribbiani said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so... What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. Pop it in. I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. What's wrong with people having sex? Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here. Hell, I wan na see Joey. So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right... oh, never mind. OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen. All I say is, she better get the job. Looks to me like he's the one getting the job. Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I ca n't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do... so I just watch' em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line, you know that's bad fo r the paper tray. Nice work my friend. Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am... So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday. Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce. Ohh... K. How come? Umm, actually, I'm getting married again. What? Oh God, I do n't know how to tell you this. I'm straight. Huuh. Yeah, I know, I. I, I do n't, I do n't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties. I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you ca n't live a lie anymore. So how long have you known? Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in. And um, and there's actually a, a woman? Her name's Debra. Oh. Well is Debra, is Debra the first that you've been with? Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. Sure. But now I know I do n't have a choice about this, I was born this way. I, I do n't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says,' Oh, I'm not gay.' I'm, I'm still me. Why could n't you have just figured this out six years ago? You know, it still smells like monkey in there. That saves us a conversation. Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. Me too, we should get goin'. No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. Rachel, that's all we do. Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie? What about Julie? Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we do n't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what do n't you like? We wan na hear everything. Well, that could take a while. So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? I got the time to get to know Julie. I got time. Rach, I know Julie pretty well, can I go? That's fine. OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like? Well, in a nutshell... Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh. So, um, have you told your parents? No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so... Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who... no, um, I'm sorry, do n't tell me, I do n't th ink either answer would make me feel better. I love you Phoebe. So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously. And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb. Mrs., Mrs. Gobb? No Cobb, as in cobb salad. Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad? I'm goin' home. What? Boy that Julie's a talker, huh? Goodnight. So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on... Oh, no no, I am. Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous? Um, no, I uh, I have done it before. Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gon na handle it. I mean, are, are ya gon na, are ya gon na talk about it before hand, are you just gon na pounce? I uh, I do n't know, I guess I'm just gon na see, see what happens. OK, gook luck. Wha, uhh, what? Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time does n't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from. OK, now I'm nervous. Maybe you should put it off. No, no, I do n't wan na put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just do n't wan na, I do n't wan na mess it up, ya know. I know, yeah, sorry. What, it's not your fault. Maybe it, maybe it does n't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that. Really? Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I do n't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen. Uh-huh. And then, I do n't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening. Ohh... Thanks Rach, goodnight. Ohh, God. Good morning. Well, somebody got some last night.

Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. You ever figure out what that thing's for? No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I do n't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I do n't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? What? I got a little drunk... and naked. Bob here. What've you been up to? Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love Jane. I know. I'm back. So, are we gon na get together or what? Um, absolutely. Uh, how' bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five - ish? Great, I'll see you then. Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when Jane sees you tomorow, she's probably gon na realize, \" hey, you're not Bob. \" I'm hoping that when Bob does n't show up, Jane will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. Oh my god. You are pure evil. Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico. Hi, Julie! Hi, Julie. Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday. Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20? Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake. Do we need a cake? Look guys, I know it's a little steep. Yeah, whoosh! But it's Ross. It's Ross. All right. I'll see you guys later, I got ta go... do a thing. Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gon na go through with this, are you? You know, I think I might just. So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight? Well I guess I got ta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies. Can you believe how much this is gon na cost? Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just do n't get that we do n't make as much money as they do? Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \" let's go here, let's go there \". Like we can afford to go here and there. Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it,' cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross. For Ross. For Ross, Ross, Ross. Oh my god. Hey. Hi. What? I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. If it's not you, this is a horrible story. Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice. Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney? I'm tellin' you. You ca n't do this. Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods. That does n't matter. Jane wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who Jane was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness. We do n't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. Go over there and tell that woman the truth. All right. Go. Hi. Hi. Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something. Yes? Whoever stood you up is a jerk. How did you --? I do n't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? Thanks. No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today. Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly - appointed head lunch chef -- Who is also in charge of purchasing. Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing -- Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there. Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister -- Oh, wait, and I got a beeper! Cool. Let's see! That's fine, I'll just wait! Oh, sorry. Sorry, sorry. Monica! Are we ready to order? Oh, you know what, we have n't even looked yet. Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat. Wow, look at these prices. Yeah, these are pretty ch - ching. What are these, like famous chickens? Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade? Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine? Oh, see, I had to tell Jade that my number was your number, because I could n't tell Jade that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number. Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls? Do I dare ask? Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. That sounds great. Same for me. And for the gentleman? Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper? You'd think, would n't you? Miss? Ok, I will have the uh, side salad. And what will that be on the side of? Uh, I do n't know. Why do n't you put it right here next to my water? And for you? Um, I'm gon na have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care. I will have the uh, Cajun catfish. Anything else? Yes, how' bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gon na sneeze on my fish, are n't you? Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks. Um, everyone? Oh, you're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Monica's big night, she should n't pay. Oh, thank you! So five of us is, $ 33.50 apiece. No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gon na happen. Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback. I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty - something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just... Ok, Pheebs! How' bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal. Not for you. All right, what's goin' on? Ok, look you guys, I really do n't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable. Fine. All right, fine. Yeah. You can tell us. Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine. Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys do n't get that uh, we do n't have as much money as you. Ok. I hear ya. We can talk about that. Well, then... Let's. I, I just never think of money as an issue. That's'cause you have it. That's a good point. So um, how come you guys have n't talked about this before?' Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. Wha --? Whoa, hey, I do n't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative -- there's gon na be a hoopla? Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing. If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. G - gift? The thing's not the gift? No, the thing was, we were gon na go see Hootie and the Blowfish. Hootie and the -- oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio. No, now I feel bad. You wan na go to the concert. No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together. All of us. Together. Not at the concert. Ok. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Yeah. So, the ebola virus. That's got ta suck, huh? Gee, Monica, what's in the bag? I do n't know, Chandler. Let's take a look. Oh, it's like a skit. Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. Whoo! Cool. Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank - you. But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope? By the way, this did n't seem so dorky in the hall. Come on. Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish! It's on us, all right, so do n't worry. It's our treat. So... Thank you. Could you be less enthused? Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like -- Like? Charity. Charity? We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here. Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. Actually, it makes us feel that big. I do n't, I do n't understand. I mean, you, it's like we ca n't win with you guys. If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel. Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel. Ok, we never should a talked about this. I'm just gon na pass on the concert,'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now. Me neither. Me too. Guys, we bought the tickets. Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. Why did you look at me when you said that? Well, I guess now we ca n't go. What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together? You know what? You're right. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. Fine. All right. We're gon na go. It's not for another six hours. We're gon na go then. Chandler! Yeah? Geez! Are you ready? Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today. Whoa! You had sex today? Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting Jane lip to stop from screaming. Wow. Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign. Still doing the screening thing? I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you did n't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy. Bob here. Oh, hi. So, uh, you met someone, huh? Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. So, uh, how was Chandler Bing? Eh. Eh? Oh, Bob, Chandler Bing was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. Well, that makes me feel so good. It was just so awkward and bumpy. Bumpy? Well, maybe Chandler Bing had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it. Well there really was n't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean? You know what? I'm not gon na be able to enjoy this. Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here. So, let's go. Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song. Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now. You know, the guys are probably having a great time. Come on you guys, one more time. Ok. One. Nooo. That was amazing! Excellent, that was excellent. I ca n't believe the guys missed this. What guys? Oh, yeah. Excuse me, you're Monica Geller are n't you? Do I know you? You used to be my babysitter. Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been? Good, good, I'm a lawyer now. You ca n't be a lawyer. You're eight. Listen, it was nice to see you. I got ta run backstage. Uh, wait, backstage? Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band. Ross. Chandler. How are you? Look, you guys wan na meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad? Hey, you guys. Happy birthday. Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night? Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours? Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him? Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad? Uh, good. Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust. Yeah, we really missed you guys. Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid. We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get -- is that a hickey? No, I just, I fell down. On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey? You know, a party, or -- What party? It was n't so much a party as... a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band. You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish? Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this. Who gave you that hickey? That would be the work of a Blowfish. Oh! Oh! I ca n't believe it. I ca n't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \" hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck \". Look, do n't blame us. You guys could a been there, you know. What, as part of your poor friends outreach program? It's work. I do n't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gon na feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it. And we do n't work hard? Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page. I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more. And you feel like we hold you back. Yes. Oh! No. Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I do n't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired. Oh. Here's your check. That'll be $ 4.12. Let me get that. You got five bucks? Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night... \n","Julie: [Julie, Julie]\n","None\n","None\n","Julie: [Julie, Julie]\n","Rodrigo: [Rodrigo, he]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","Jane: [Jane, Jane, Jane, she, Jane]\n","None\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","None\n","Jane: [Jane, Jane, Jane, she, Jane]\n","None\n","None\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","Jane: [Jane, Jane, Jane, she, Jane]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","Jane: [Jane, Jane, Jane, she, Jane]\n","Julie: [Julie, Julie, Julie]\n","None\n","Julie: [Julie, Julie, Julie]\n","Julie: [Julie, Julie, Julie]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","None\n","None\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","None\n","tonight: [tonight, tonight]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","None\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Leon: [Leon, his]\n","Ross: [Ross, his, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross, Ross]\n","None\n","Jane: [Jane, Jane, that woman, her, this woman, she]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob]\n","Jane: [Jane, Jane, that woman, her, this woman, she]\n","None\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Roland: [Roland, Roland]\n","Roland: [Roland, Roland]\n","None\n","None\n","Chandler: [Chandler, you, Chandler]\n","Jade: [Jade, she, Jade, Jade, Jade]\n","Jade: [Jade, she, Jade, Jade, Jade]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Monica: [Monica, she, Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica]\n","None\n","None\n","Monica: [Monica, she, Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica]\n","Rachel: [Rachel, his]\n","Joey: [Joey, Joey]\n","None\n","None\n","Monica: [Monica, she, Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica]\n","None\n","Hootie: [Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie]\n","None\n","Hootie: [Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie]\n","None\n","Monica: [Monica, she, Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica]\n","Chandler: [Chandler, Chandler]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Chandler: [Chandler, Chandler]\n","None\n","Hootie: [Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie]\n","None\n","None\n","Ross: [Ross, Ross]\n","None\n","Hootie: [Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","None\n","Chandler Bing: [Chandler Bing, Chandler Bing, Chandler Bing]\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","Chandler Bing: [Chandler Bing, Chandler Bing, Chandler Bing]\n","Chandler Bing: [Chandler Bing, Chandler Bing, Chandler Bing]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","little Stevie Fisher: [little Stevie Fisher, little Stevie Fisher, Stevie]\n","None\n","Ross: [Ross, Ross]\n","Chandler: [Chandler, you, Chandler]\n","None\n","None\n","little Stevie Fisher: [little Stevie Fisher, little Stevie Fisher, Stevie]\n","Hootie: [Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie, Hootie]\n","little Stevie Fisher: [little Stevie Fisher, little Stevie Fisher, Stevie]\n","a hickey: [a hickey, the hickey, that hickey, hickey]\n","Joey: [Joey, Joey]\n","Blowfish: [a Blowfish, Blowfish]\n","Monica: [Monica, she, Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Bob: [Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob here, Bob, you, Bob]\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Who da wenny - Benny boy?

No I did n't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. And that's what's gon na kill me. I'm allergic to kiwi. No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and -- oh my god. Ugh. Oh my god. Ugh. It's definitely getting worse. Is your tongue swelling up? Either that or my mouth is getting smaller. All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital. Is Ross Geller gon na be ok? Yeah, Ross Geller's just got ta get a shot. You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble? Jacket now. What about Ben? We ca n't bring a baby to a hospital. We'll watch Ben. I do n't think tho. What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wan na do it, do n't we? I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window. Ok, well, if you do take Ben out for his walk, you might wan na bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag. Hat, milk, got it.??? Thro up a thro thro -- a thro thro! Consider it done. You understood that? Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue. Is Uncle Sal the one with the beautiful wife? Hey Rach, wan na hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower. Ok. I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget. Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute? What's up? F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. Stephanie's supposed to be very good. But what about Phoebe? Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, Phoebe Buffay makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around. Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you can not do this to her. Uh -- Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her? Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed. You know, I do n't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil? It's gon na be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gim me the baby. No, I got Person 1. No, seriously. Oh, seriously you want Person 1? Hello. Hello. And who is this little cutie pie? Well, do n't, do n't think me immodest, but, me? You wan na smell Person 1? I assume we're talking about the baby now. Oh, yeah. Person 1's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head. I think my uterus just skipped a beat. What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you? I think it's great you guys are doing this. Well, we are great guys. You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through? But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you ca n't just erase chalk. Honey, I'm sorry. And he's going to be paying this woman? Why does n't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top. Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying \" Terry's a jerk! \" That's where that came from. Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. Ok, you know what, lem me, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why do n't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever - her - name - is. I mean, you wo n't even be here. You do n't pay her. It's not gon na cost you anything. I, I do n't know. Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine. You do n't clean the cappuccino machine? Of course I clean it. I mean, I, I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it. Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine. Done. Really? Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe? Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gon na get? What? Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing. Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gon na be paying that other woman beause she's a professional. Well, I'm not gon na be the only one who's not getting paid. Well, but Pheebs. No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play. When I play, I play for me, I do n't need your charity. Thank you! La la la la la la la.... Well, there's no way I'm gon na get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction. Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles. Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea? My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now. Tho? Ohhh. That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's got ta be a needle. You're just gon na have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me? Ok. Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wan na squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, do n't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, do n't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand! That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wan na pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi! Hey, hey, look at that talent. Just practicing. You're good. Carry on. Hey, you. He's just adorable. Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink. So what are you guys out doing today? Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff. You done? Yeah. Oh, there's our stop. Get outta here. This is our stop too. You guys live around here too? Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk. You know it? Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink? So uh, you wan na go to Marquel's? Oh, sure, they love us over there. Where's your baby? Ben! Ben! Ben! Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord. Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! Are you sure he did n't break it because it really hurts. No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate.... with the double double double - jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player? Yeah. I'm Stephanie. Right. My name was on there, but now it just says \" carrot cake \". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know? All of them. Oh yeah, so you know D? Yeah. Ok, do you know A minor? Yeah. Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor? Yeah. Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap? No. Oh. Mine does. Stephanie knows all the chords. Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er. Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again. Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to -- Terry's a jerk, and he wo n't let me work, and I hate Central Perk! Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer. Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved. Zachary. You're all invited to bite me! Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here? He's here. I'm assuming one of you is the father. That's me. I'm him. Actually, uh, we're both the father. Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy! Please tell me you know which one is our baby. Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks. Ok. Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth. Yeah? Yeah. Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off. Ahh! What're we gon na do? What're we gon na do? Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns. Oh, we're gon na flip for the baby? You got a better idea? All right, call it in the air. Heads. Heads it is. Yes! Whew! We have to assign heads to something. Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads. What kind of scary - ass clowns came to your birthday? Hey. Oh, hi. Here. I thought you might be cold. Thank you. Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well. Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really,'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better. Do you? No. This whole like playing - for - money thing is so not good for me. You know, I do n't know, when I sang \" Su - Su - Suicide \", I got a dollar seventy - five. But then, \" Smelly Cat \", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat. Well, you know, honey, I do n't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh! It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money. Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \" Smelly Cat \". Really? From who? Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite. Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency. Yeah. Here you go. Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it! I just wan na thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I, I almost broke your hand. That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you. Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand? Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle? Oh. Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin? Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? No. But I remember people telling me about it. I hope Ben has a little sister. Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass. I'm gon na get a new band - aid. Hey, how' bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken? That was you? They, uh, were infected. He would n't have made it. Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying. Hey, he's not crying. Yes! There's still pie. I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today? Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today. Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus -- Hey, I have a question.

Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting. Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight? No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation. Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wan na work out? I can remake you. Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time. Please. C'mon. Let her. Yeah. Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home. Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here. Oh, ca n't make.... hands... meet.... OK, let's do it. What? Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before. And we're changing. C'mon give me five more. Five more. No. Five more and I'll flash you. One... two... two and a half. OK, just show me one of them. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.. She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. Monica Geller's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they wo n't bring me my mail anymore. Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night? Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice. The guy still wo n't put out, huh? Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh. Sorry Phoebs. Look, I, y'know, I do n't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know Scott Alexander's really interesting and Scott Alexander's really sweet and why wo n't he give it up? Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean. No, whad'ya mean? Scott Alexander's not British. Maybe Scott Alexander's... gay. Oohh, um, no, I do n't think that's the problem.' Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something. Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look? No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell. Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes. Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it. Ooh, oh, Rachel, do n't look. What? C'mon you guys, I do n't care, I have a date tonight. Woah, woah, woah, you have a date? Yeah, Monica's settin' me up. But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh...? Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity. So you really OK about all this? Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. Ross Geller can press her up against that window as much as Ross Geller wants. For all I care, Ross Geller can throw Julie through the damn thing. Hi guys. Hey. Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK? Only if you say his full name. Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy. Alright. You're getting a cat? Uh, actually, we're getting a cat. Together? Uh huh. Both of you? Yep. Together. Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time. Ohh, well, is n't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time. Hopefully. Well. Woah, look at that! I got ta go, I got ta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat. OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave. I do n't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am. How long do cats live? I'm sorry? Cats, how long do they live figuring you do n't... y'know, throw' em under a bus or something? Um, maybe 15, 16 years. That's just great. Um, cheers. Oh, right, clink. Monica told you I was cuter that this, did n't Monica Geller? Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend. Oh, that does sound... Ahh. I mean Ross Geller just started going out with Julie. Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend? Ah, hah - hah - hah - ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you. Alright. OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend? So, I figured it out. What? Why Scott does n't want to sleep with me. It's'cause I'm not sexy enough. Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, \" Excellent butt, great rack. \" Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet. Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gon na have to ask Scott Alexander. You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why ca n't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something? What're they called, what're they called, what're they called? Fruitflies? Yes! Thank you. So, would you like any dessert? No! No dessert, just a check, please. Oh, you're not having fun, are you? No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head. Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over Ross Geller. gosh, why ca n't I do that? Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gon na be fine. You just ca n't see it now because you have n't had any closure. Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why did n't I think of that? How do I get that? Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, \" I'm over you. \" Closure, that's what it is. Closure. Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel... woo Hang on. Hello, excuse me. What. Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute. I'm talkin'! I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself. OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone. Alright, fine. I'll call you back. Thank you. OK. Machine. Just waiting for the beep. Good. Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. No, no, no, no, no, no No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday. Why not? Because it's Sunday. It's God's day. OK, if you say stop, then we stop. OK, stop. No, c'mon, we ca n't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo - woo, woo - woo, woo - woo Woo. Hey Rach. Ahhhh. Oh. And how was the date? Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine... Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say... What? Why, why are you looking at me like that? I do n't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I do n't remember. OK. Oh, oh, oh. Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me? No, I stayed at Julie's last night. Huh. Oh, actually I have n't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages? Oh yeah, go ahead. Rach, I got a message from you. Who's Michael? Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the... You're over me? Ohhhhhhhh God. Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me? Ohh, ohh. When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh... What? Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you. You've had feelings for me? Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first. Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know? Chandler told me. Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did Chandler Bing? When you were in China. China. Meeting Julie. Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gon na stand. I'm gon na stand, I'm gon na walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me? Are you over me? That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie. Hi Julie. Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting. I'll be right down. Wait, so, you're going? Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I ca n't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gon na go get a cat. OK, OK. Cat. Hey Joey. Hey Phoebs. How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar? I ca n't find the remote. Thank you. So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did. And? And we did. All right Phoebs, way to go. Yay me. So, so how did it happen? Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on. And what did he say? He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gon na get all, y'know, like,' ohh, is he gon na call me the next day' and, y'know,' where is this going' and, ya know, blah - la - la - la - la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious. Wow. Yeah, so I said, \" OK, relax please, \" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking... I convinced him. Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea. Um - hum. This man is my God. Hi. I did n't get a cat. Oh, that's um, interesting. No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting. Alright, I got it Ross. You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me. What? I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you. Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie? Then you should have said something before I met her. I did n't know then. And how come you never said anything to me. There was never a good time. Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night. Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I did n't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys. Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point? The point is I... I do n't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed. Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me? Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it. Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross. Fine.' Cause I do n't need your stupid ship. Good. Good. And ya know what, now I've got closure. Try the bottom one. Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over. No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'. OK, I do n't, I do n't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so do n't make me do anything that I'll regret. Ooh, what'cha gon na do, fat boy, huh? What? Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have. Well, thanks. I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work. Well, you know. You know, I mean, you ca n't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed. Uh-huh. And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on. Well no, but um. I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all. Y'know, I try to stay positive... So, you feel like goin' for a run? Alright. Because, you know, you do n't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here. OK. Just for a little while.

Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues? Oh, it ended very well. Oh. Do not start without me. Do not start without me. Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a \" I got ta have you now \" kind of thing? Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it. Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back? No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair. Ohhhh. And, uh, and then I kissed her. Tongue? Yeah. Cool. All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built - in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s. Wow. What are you gon na use it for? Games and stuff. There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me. Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked? There's an ad for a naked chef? No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... Hi. Hey, oh, so, um... how'd you make out last night? That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful Wait a minute. I thought last night was great. Yeah, it was, but... I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gon na throw all that away? You got all that from saline solution? We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel. Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and...... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel. Hey, you. How are you? Good. How are you? Good. Hi, honey. Hi, Julie. Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you? Good. Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gon na play something, Phoebe? Oh, well, actually. Play it. Ok, all right. Hey, Julie, I did n't know you wore lenses. What? Ssshh. Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, \" Two of Them Kissed Last Night \". There was a girl, we'll call Rachel Green Betty, and a guy let's call Ross Geller Neil. Now I ca n't stress this point too strongly, this story is n't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who Ross Geller loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju... Loolie? Ross Geller must decide, he must decide, even though I made Ross Geller up, he must decide! This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo. So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad was n't too clear. Mockolate. I'm sorry? Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute. Ohh. Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate. All right. Mmm - mmm. Yeah? I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate does n't do that. No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food - preparation holidays : Easter, Christmas, what have you. Mmm - mmm. But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday. Wow. Are n't you going to swallow that? Just waiting for it to stop bubbling. Yeah, is n't that great? Mmm. Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving - themed recipes. You think you might be interested? Abso...... lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate. Really? Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas. How about Mockolate mousse? It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving - y. Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse? What makes it pilgrim? We'll put buckles on it. Hey. Hey. Hey. Did uh, Ross call? No, I'm sorry. Why did n't Ross Geller call? He's gon na stay with Julie, is n't he? Ross Geller's gon na stay with Julie and she's going to be all, \" Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gon na to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together. \" No offense, but that sounds nothing like Julie. I do n't know what to do. What am I gon na do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare. Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight. Hey, here's a thought, Ross. Do n't touch the computer. Do n't ever touch the computer. Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome. Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column. Ca n't we just use a pen? No, Amish boy. Ok, let's start with the cons,'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first. I do n't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say Rachel Green's a little spoiled sometimes. You could say that. And I guess, you know, sometimes, Rachel Green's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress. Waitress. Got it. You guys wan na play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else? I do n't know. Oh, her ankles are a little chubby. Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her? She's not Rachel. Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served. Oh my god. Oh my god good? Oh my god, I ca n't believe you let me put this in my mouth. Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like! I'm telling you this thing wo n't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek? Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart? Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing. So, Spock actually hugs his father? Hey, do you guys have...... hi. Hi. Where you goin'? I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's. Oh. No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing. Well, what's the other thing, what do I think? Well, uh. He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes. Really? Really. It's always been you, Rach. Oh, god. Ohhh. Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good. I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them? Let me get my coat. Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat. Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I ca n't believe this. This is unbelievable. What's that? What? Nothing. What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it? No, no, see? See? Hey, it's printing. Hey, it's printing! Well what is it? Let me see. Hey, someone order a coat? Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he wo n't let me see. He wo n't? He wo n't! Because, is n't that, is n't that the, the short story you were writing? Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing. And I'm in it? Then let me read it. No! Come on. Hey, uh, why do n't you read it to her? Alright. \" It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch.' Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end. \" That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world. All right, you know what? This is n't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it. No, you do n't. All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. What is this? Ross, what is this? Good luck. Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok? Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled? Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type \" little \", the idiot. Just a waitress? No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach? Oh! I do not have chubby ankles! No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column. She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I would n't know because I'm just a waitress. No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra -- Rachel? My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told Rachel Green it was my diary, Rachel Green never would have made me read her my diary. You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency. I... I can not believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus. Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea. What? What? Oh good, I was hoping that would come up. This was your idea? What were you thinking? All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason. Yeah. You! All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, do n't you? Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle. Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please! When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That does n't mean please climb up the fire escape. I just wan na read something. It's your pro list. Not interested. Ok, ok, number one : The way you cry at game shows. Number two : how much you love your friends. Number three : the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four : how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five : how great you are with Ben. Number six : the way you smell. Hey, Ross! What are you doin'? Hey, Joey. You wan na open the window? Oh, yeah, I do. What are you doing out there? I am, uh, I am... Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate? Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance. No. No? That's what I said. Look, maybe we should go? No, you guys, you really do n't have to go, we're done talking. Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel. No, you do n't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you. No, but, but I wan na be with you in spite of all those things. Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross. I said do n't go! You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you. Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list. I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know? Maybe a little longer. Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate. Does n't matter. What? Our FDA approval did n't come through. Something about laboratory rats. Oh, gosh, I'm sorry. Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check. Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you did n't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you? Well, uh, I ate some. Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it does n't burn when you pee, does it? Hello? Hi. Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down. Listen, I... I do n't think this is the best time. Look, can, can you do something for me? Sure, what? Ok, ok. Music? The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I do n't wan na play your song anymore. Why do n't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out. Hi, thanks for coming in again. Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash. It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called \" fishtachios \". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you? Cat hair.

Yeah, we were gon na give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we do n't wan na look bad. Oh, actually this year we just made Mr. Adelman homemade cookies. And twenty - five it is. You gave Mr. Adelman cookies? Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares... Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that. I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick. Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies? Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them. So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies? Uhh, the mailman, the super. Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy. Oh my God. What? Uhhh, I do n't think you're gon na like this. Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section. Oh look, and Man 1 did my crossword puzzle. Yeah, but not very well, unless 14 - across,' Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme. I ca n't believe it's Christmas already.

How have you never been on Oprah? OK, look, see, this is Man 1. My mother gave me this picture before Lily Buffay died, same guy.

Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again? Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come? Just, you know, to see... um. Oh, sure, yeah. This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here Man 2 is at a graduation... another graduation... another graduation. OK, is this really my father? Is it really your fa -- I ca n't... well of course it is. OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's'cause someone's pants are on fire. Look, I... Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me. Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame. Oh God. It was your mother's idea. Ya know, Lily Buffay did n't want you to know your real father because it hurt Lily Buffay so much when he left, and, I did n't want to go along with it, but, well then Lily Buffay died and, and it was harder to argue with Lily Buffay. Not impossible, but harder. Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, Frank Buffay does n't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones? Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate. OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist? Honey. Oh. Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this. This is the real Frank Buffay. Oh. Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. Charles Bing did n't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up. Well, that does n't sound like a very merry Christmas. Who said anything about Christmas? Hi. Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet? No, nothin'. I hope she's OK. Yeah, I know exactly what Phoebe Buffay's goin' through. How do you know exactly what she's going through? Phoebe Buffay told us. So whaddya got there Monica? Just some stuff for the party. Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, are n't you supposed to be Christmas shopping? You guys have n't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gon na do? Do n't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that? Oh, by the way Mon, I do n't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just did n't give Judy Geller enough. Monica, pigeons learn faster that you. Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How' bout you make a list about me. Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gon na stand here and make a list of... C'mon Rachel. OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you do n't ever, you do n't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you did n't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair. See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said. Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay... OK, um, in Ithica... alright, um, Saratoga... Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you should n't call youself information. Hey. Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name. C'mon now Phoe, do n't still be mad at me. How's it going? Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, Frank Buffay's pretty small, you do the math. Well, I think you're better off without Frank Buffay. Oh honey, I know Frank Buffay's your daddy but, but to me Frank Buffay's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole Lily Buffay Gremlin. No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know. I know. OK, I was n't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I did n't know exactly where Frank Buffay lived. Whattaya mean? He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab. Wow. Thank you. Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab. Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gon na see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! Commercial Phoebe here with the cab yet? Yeah, she, Phoebe Buffay brought the invisible cab... hop in. Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7. Hey, do n't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time. Hey, here she comes. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gon na have a dad. Eeeshk. Eeeshk. Yeah, big stuff. OK, let's go. OK. Alright, here, you have to hold this. OK. Brake left, gas right? Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet. Where's my seat belt? Oh, no no, that side does n't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. Hey! Hey. C'mon, just tell me, please, please. For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive. Oh, gosh, it's hot in here. Rach, get the heat. Ross, could you turn the heat down please? Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and... Ross, the heat! Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one. OK, this way is on, so this is... off. Did you just break the radiator? No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and... here it is. Well put it back. It uhh, it wo n't go back. I'll call the super. Here, let me try. Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal. Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny. Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we ca n't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight. OK, tip the man. No, if Mr. Treeger does n't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gon na be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party. Hey, here's a theme : Come on in, live like bacon. Ooh, this is it, 74. Oh, so that's what this is for. Wow, this is it, I'm gon na meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh. Yeah. Sure is. OK, here I go. I'm goin' in. Alright. Good luck Phoebs. OK, here I go... here I go... I'm goin'. Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom. It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much? Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright. Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK. Really? I'm perfectly comfortable. Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. Mr. Treeger. Uhh, you said there was a party. Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna. Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese! Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give Mr. Treeger cash, Rachel give Rachel Green your earrings. Something, now, anything. No, I will not cave. Yeah, I'm with Mon. Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though Mr. Treeger's your super, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas. Oh wow, I did n't get you anything. Here's five back. No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now? No can do, like I told the girl, I ca n't get a new knob until Thursday. Ross. Yeah. Looks like Mr. Treeger's playin' baseball. You mean hardball? Whatever. What'cha gon na' do? Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting? No, the place is not open' till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right. So, wait, you really did like my cookies? Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared. Nice seizing... gel boy. So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe? Huh - huh, no act -- no, uhh, that, that is basil. Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gon na kiss ya. Huh - hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil. OK. How far'd ya get? Mailbox. Alright, we're gettin' closer. Uh-huh. Phoebs, what's goin' on? No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and... Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy. Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me' cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter. Well, so why not go knock? Well,' cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I do n't think I'm ready to lose a real one. Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today. Yeah? Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges. Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you. You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping. Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out. Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas. Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here! Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down? Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier. Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go. Oh, I could n't go in. Honey, I'm sorry. Are you OK? Yeah, yeah, no it's OK' cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now. Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright. Rach, these are for you. Wiper blades. I do n't even have a car. No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do. OK, Phoebs, your turn. Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas? Uh-huh. You guuuyys. And for Ross, Mr. Sweet - tooth. You got me a cola drink? And, a lemon lime. Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater. And last but not least. They're ribbed for your pleasure. \n","Ugly Naked Guy: [Ugly Naked Guy, his]\n","None\n","this year: [this year, this year,

Hiiiiii. Are... are you OK? Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th -- Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is Fun Bobby, what. Fun Bobby, Fun Bobby's here, is n't Fun Bobby? Maybe. Do n't toy with me. Geller! Hey, Fun Bobby! Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh? Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister! You and me both. Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon? Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better. Hey, do you need me to pick you up? No, I'm alright man. Really. No, I'm picking you up. Hey no, seriously, I do n't need you to pick me... Alright! It still works. OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up? I'm still gon na go. OK, I'll see you later babe. Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. See ya. Bye! See you later! Fun Bobby is so great. Oh, is n't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with Fun Bobby. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full. Half full of looooovvvvve. And for our two - week anniversary, he's gon na take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend. Cabin of loooooovvvvve. We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. Really? I only had two glasses. I just had a glass. Two. I had one glass. I had about a mugful in this lovely' I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug. OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five? Oooooh. Ooooooh. So what. So Fun Bobby drank a lot tonight. Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I do n't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand. Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how Fun Bobby always starts his stories with, um, OK,' I was soooo wasted,' or,' Oh, we were soooo bombed,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh,' So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.' Monica, have you ever been with Fun Bobby when Fun Bobby was n't drinking? Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo. Rach, does this have nonfat milk? Ehhhummmm, I do n't know, why do n't you taste it. Mmmm, no. Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some. Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish? Um, cake. Yeah, we're gon na... we're gon na get some cake. You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately. Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask. Bobby. Yeah, OK. Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I do n't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you. OK, look, this is n't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I do n't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh...' I'm just a social drinker,' or,' C'mon, it's Flag Day.' So, what are you saying now? I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. Sooo, what's goin' on, huh? I am gon na try and quit drinking. Ooohh, why? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Guess who's back in show business. Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green? No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause Lorne Green's dead. Oh, no. OK, I guess this is gon na seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who. Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives! Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme. Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia. Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gon na do something tonight. Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I... I kinda got plans. You have other friends? Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date. What? With a man? What? What is so strange about me having a date? What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at Ross Geller cause Ross Geller made that list about you? Noooo, no, I'm not mad at Ross Geller. I'm.. I'm not really anything at Ross Geller anymore. What are you talking about? I do n't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not. But you guys came so close. Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gon na have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross. Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ. Hhhhiiiii. Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later. Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition? Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday. Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic? No. Well, here it is. OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady... Oh, is n't Lori a doll? Oh yeah, yeah, Lori's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that Lori was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in. Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gon na put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how' bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, is n't he terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gon na have to sleep with her. What's the matter? It's Fun Bobby. What, is n't he sober? Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason. Ohhh, OK. Alright, here you go, sweetie. Thanks. You wan na hear something funny? Oh God, yes! There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village. That is funny. I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village. Ahhh, hey honey? Do n't you have to be at your interview now? Oh yeah. See you guys. Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby. Oh.... my... God. It's not that bad. Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story? OK, OK, do n't get all squinky. Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there. But I'm gon na be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I ca n't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me. Alright, do n't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free. Hi. Hey Ross.... bahhhh! Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK? OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend - type.... people. Rachel? Um, hi. Hi. OK, so, you know what you're doing, right? Uhh.... waitressing? Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... does n't.... does n't Russ just remind you of someone? Huh, Bob Saget? Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh. Oh, my, oh! What? What's wrong? I, OK.... She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning. Alright. Listen, Phoebs, this is gon na be OK. Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross. Hi. Hi. Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's? Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's? Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date - type... thing... of Rachel's. A date. Yeah, I'm her date. Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date. You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare. Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist. Yes, yes I am. And you are a.... Periodontist. See? They're as different as night and... later that night. Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you. Ditto. I, uh, well... I... I met Russ. Oh. Hey, I did n't know we were, uh, seeing other people. Well, we're not seeing each other, so.... Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal... Well, yeah, this is the deal. OK, well, um, have a nice evening. Um, Russ, you ready? Yeah. Bye. Bye. Bye. She's dating. She's dating. Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating? What do you mean? Do you not see it? See what? I do n't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I do n't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence. Yeah, it's annoying, is n't it?.................... Yeah. Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you did n't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry. Well, the part's mine if I want it. Oh my God! Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady. Oh my... God? Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television. So, what're you gon na do? Well, I guess I could sleep with Lori... I mean, how could I do that? Well, I... I've got a pop - up book that told me everything I need to know. I've never slept with someone for a part. Well is Lori... Sorry. It's alright. Is she good - looking? Yeah, Lori's totally good looking. I mean, if I met Lori in a bar, or something, I'd be buying Lori breakfast. You know, after having slept with her. Y'know, maybe this is n't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas. I just... I just do n't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gon na look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General. Did n't you used to call it the Little Major? Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it. Can I get you something from the bar? Yes, I would like something. No, no thank you. If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it. No, no really. I.. I would n't feel right about it. Just some water. So the light went out in my refrigerator... I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist. Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wan na do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium. Dysprosium. Dysprosium? Try mendelevium. And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine - down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues. You do n't see it? You actually do n't see it? What? OK honey, you're dating Ross. No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ. Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross! Steve... sleeve! OK, noone is named Sleeve. Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing. For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark. You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful. OK, I'm gon na get some more coffee before the pinching and eye - poking begins. I know what your problem is. Oh you do, do you? Um - hum, you're jealous. Of... of what? You're jealous because I'm a real doctor. Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma. Hey, you listen. No, no, let me finish. No, let me finish. No, you let me fini... Hi. Hi. Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! Did Joey say what he was gon na go when he left? No, I do n't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job? I do n't know. Who would I have to sleep with? Me. Why would I have to sleep with you? It's my game. You want the job or not? Hey. Morning. Where ya goin'? Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember? Ooooohhhh. What's with all the bottles of liquor? What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again? Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing. Oh God, even his knock is boring. Hi. I'll be ready in just a second. Uh, can I talk to you a minute? Sure. This is really hard for me to say. Oh God, you fell off the wagon. Oh, no, no, it's about you. What about me? I think you may have a drinking problem. What these? Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes. Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK? Oh... shoot. Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends. OK. Take care. You too. What happened? Well we... we kinda broke up. Awwwwwwww. Does anybody want these? I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant. Hey. Hey! How'd the callback go? It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me. So what'd you do? Well, I could n't do it. I told her I did n't want to get the part that way. Good for you. But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part. So... and? Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes! Allright! Alright... I've got to go shower. Hi. Oh, hey. Hi. I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me. Yeah, I'm sorry man. Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about? Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him. Oh. Hey. Hey! Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing? Um, oh, I do n't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um.... \n","None\n","Fun Bobby: [Fun Bobby, Bobby, Fun Bobby's, Fun Bobby, Bobby, me, Fun Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, he, Fun Bobby, Bobby, he, he, his, Fun

Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh... oh, Ben. Hi! So how did everything go? Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but Ben started it. Well, we've got ta go. Ok. Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. Oh, you and me? Uh, no, Susan and me. The other us. Ok. We're uh, we're getting married. As in, \" I now pronounce you wife and wife \" married? Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you do n't want to. Why would n't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding. Look I just thought that... No no no, I mean, hey, why should n't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I could n't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me! Is your finger caught in that chair? Mmm hmmm. Want us to go? Uh-huh. This is so cool. You're actually gon na be on television. It really hit me last night. I'm gon na be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.. Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and Carol and Susan's caterer's in a full body cast. Yes! They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this is n't a problem for you, is it? Would it matter? Oh, you are so great! Thank you! Are you really not going? I am really not going. I do n't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married? They love each other, and they wan na celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. If you wan na call that a reason. Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor. Ross, I thought you were over this. Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. Did I miss it? Did I miss it? No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Whoa, Mrs. Wallace's pretty. Yeah, and Mrs. Wallace's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell - the - fart acting. I'm sorry, what? What? It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. Oh, ok. There's my scene, there's my scene. \" Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. Is she gon na be all right? I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a.. subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. Nice! That's great! Excellent! For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. That is so good! Do it again! All right, all right. \" Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart! \" That's great. All right, I got ta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. No no, that's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello. Oh, thanks. I could n't uh... Is everything ok? Um, no, huh - uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. Oh my god. That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get. Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman. Oh, honey. Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, Mrs. Adelman probably woke up today and thought, \" ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage. \" Little did she know God was thinking, \" Ok, but that's it. \" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing Mrs. Adelman aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I do n't think it went very far. What do you mean? I think it went into me. God, this is so hard. I ca n't decide between lamb or duck. Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks. Ok, who ordered what? Oh, I believe I had the half - drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? Oh god. I ca n't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just do n't want Mrs. Green to think that because I did n't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know? Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time. Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? I do n't know. I mean, Mrs. Adelman obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up! There Rachel Green is. Mom! Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun. Pretty much. Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten. This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. Oh hello, Ross. Hi, Mrs. Green. So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? Oh Mom! If you did n't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. Believe me, sometimes that happens. This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you. Really? Yes. I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer.' Course, that's before Evelyn Dermer got the lousy face lift. Now Evelyn Dermer looks like Soupy Sales. Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer? I do n't know. Who's Soupy Sales? Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello. Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. You have some life here, sweetie. I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I did n't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? I do. You did n't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. For... me. Well, not just for you. Well, what do you mean? I'm uh, considering leaving your father. All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. Oh god. I think I'm gon na be sick. Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. And you had no idea they were n't getting along? None. They did n't fight a lot? No! They did n't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? In my day, divorce was not an option. Hey, look who's up. I just ca n't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I would n't have to worry about this. Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, Mrs. Green's doing it because Mrs. Green wants to be more like you. Well, then, you know, could n't Mrs. Green have just copied my haircut? You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and Woman 1 told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true. That's him. Damn. My mail order grandfather has n't come yet. Phoebe? Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting. Um, do you wan na sit? Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear? I do n't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left Mrs. Adelman body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. You're saying, my wife is in you? Yeah. Ok, you do n't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? Well, I do n't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that Mrs. Adelman always used to say that before Mrs. Adelman died, Mrs. Adelman wanted to see everything. Everything? Everything. Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. Oh, wait, I remember, Mrs. Adelman also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. Worth a shot, huh? Look at this. These are from Halloween three years ago. Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office? No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist. Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \" thank you, but I do n't really need your help \"? Actually, what I think you said was, \" do n't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen. \" Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I do n't think I planned enough time to actually do it. Hey, Mon, you want some help? If you want. Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty. She's still with you? Yeah. I guess she has n't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. Oh, such a pretty face. This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana? God! All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food. That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex? Oh! What's new in sex? The only man I've ever been with is your father. I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I do n't hear anything. I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more. Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I can not have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing? No. You want me to talk you out of it? No. Then what? What do you want? I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this. Why on earth would I understand this? You did n't marry your Barry. I did. Oh. All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move! Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles. Joey, speed it up! I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets! Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out. Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wan na see me cry? Sir! No sir! All right, you! No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing. All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you do n't help me cook, I'm gon na take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gon na create a new appetizer called \" pigs in Ross \". All right, ball the melon. Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon. Hi. How's it going? It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. Fine, whatever. What's the matter? Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. What? You're still gon na pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. Carol, what's the matter? What happened? My parents called this afternoon to say they were n't coming. Oh my god. I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. It's ok. I'm sorry. And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and Susan Bunch said we were n't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I could n't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I do n't know what to do. I uh ca n't believe I'm gon na say this, but I think Susan's right. You do? Look, do you love Susan Bunch? And you do n't have to be too emphatic about this. Of course I do. Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide ca n't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents did n't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it. You're right. Of course you're right. So we're back on? We're back on. You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I ca n't believe I lost 2 minutes. It just seems so futile, you know? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I can not fly. Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. Thank you. Any time. Ross. You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. Would you look at them? Yeah, ca n't help but. How's that pig - in - the - blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I miss Rose. Oh, yeah? I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone. You know, I uh, I could n't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life... how' bout we go get you a drink? Ok, that's so nice. I should n't even bother coming up with a line, right? Hey, Mom? Having fun? Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wan na pursue, but it's nice to know I have options. There's more alcohol, right? How you doin'? Ok. You did a good thing today. Yeah. You wan na dance? No, that's fine. Come on. I'll let you lead. Ok. All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. Ok, which one of us do you think is gon na be the first one to get married?

Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. I can see that,'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin. And the fact that they're both monkeys. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat... all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem. Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got. Rhythm? No, my first fan mail. Alright!' Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh.' Your not - so - secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait,' PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. This was n't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. Hey guys. Hey. Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake? Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. You know I think he will be surprised,' till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, is n't capable of that emotion. Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now. I know, I know. Hello. Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen. Hi Rob Dohnen. I do n't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great. Oh, wow. Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? Oh, I would love to have kids... you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them. Hey, whaddya wan na do for dinner? Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. Hello. It's Erica. Ah, the stalker. Never mind, it's open. Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wan na have a backup plan, though, just in case she is n't a cartoon. Let's get out of here. The one time they're not home. OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she wo n't know it's me'cause we've never met. That's how radio stars escape stalkers. She's comin'. It's me. Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gon na die. Ready? Wait, wait, wait. Hi. Erica. Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. Well, I uh, I ca n't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel. Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. Oh my God, what happened? Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. I ca n't believe this. I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying,' Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. Well, ya know, someone should have called me. I'm sorry. Look, I know this ca n't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. Zoo dollars? Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey has n't just died. Ooohhh. I know. I ca n't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i -, what is she like. Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery? Yeah. Well, she looks the exact opposite of that. And she's not crazy? Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore. Oh my God. Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? Joey Tribbiani can not persue this. Hey, just because this woman thinks Erica Ford can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room does n't mean she's not a person. I mean, does Erica Ford not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? Joey Tribbiani's the one who wants to boff the maniac. You OK? No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear. That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown - ups. Ya know, they just, grown - ups drink their coffee and do their grown - up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gon na kiss me? I was thinkin' about it. OK. OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe Hi Phoebe. OK, um, I'm gon na play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. Now, grandma's a person who everyone likes, Woman 1 bought you a train and a bright, shiny bike. But lately Woman 1 has n't been coming to dinner, And last time you saw Woman 1 she looked so much thinner. Now, your mom and your dad said she moved to Peru, but the truth is Woman 1 died and some day you will too. La - la - la la la - la - la la la - la - la la... Oh, Drake, is n't it amazing? Yeah it is... what? Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites. Who's they? No one. Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them... but I wo n't. Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life - giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one? Alright, just one. Wow, you're good at that. Oh my God! Someone, Man 1's choking. Is anyone here a doctor? Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore. Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes. Uhh, hey look, I do n't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars? It's about your monkey. It's alive. I do n't understand, why did n't you help that man? Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something. No, no no no, you do n't have to tell me anything. You do n't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore? But that's what... I should just be happy to be near you. Hey I - Hey what? That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY! Hey. He - hey. There'll be times when you get older when you'll want to sleep with people just to make them like you... But do n't. Cause that's another thing that you do n't wan na do, everybody That's another thing that you do n't wan na do. Excellent! Very informative! Not at all inappropriate! Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back. That was great, the kids loved you. Yay, I rock. And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth. You were incredible. But. How did you know there was a but? I sense these things. It was either but or butter. The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. I can do that. Really? Yeah. Because that would be fantastic. What? You wan na kiss me? Thinkin' about it. Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. Buddy, my monkey? Oh, yeah, right. There was a break - in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken. Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. Of course they're gon na say he's dead. They do n't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover - up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes? That guy Lipson? Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows? No, I, I only know Lipson. Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside - down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with... Buddy, my monkey, my monkey. Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo. Of course. Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know. This is unbelievable. So, what is this information worth to you, my friend? Are you trying to get me to bribe you? Maybe. But you already told me everything. Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey. Well, so what're you gon na do? Well, I guess I'm gon na call the beer company and try to find out where he is. That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales. OK, hi again. Hi Phoebe. Today we're gon na start with some songs about barnyard animals. Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo, Oh, the cow in the meadow goes moo. Then the farmer hits him on the head and grinds him up, And that's how we get hamburgers. Nooowww, chickens! You're the only one who can save her Drake. Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God. Well, there goes my whole belief system. It's Erica. Oh my God, quick turn off the TV. No no no, wait, I wan na see what happens. Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out. Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina? Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro - surgeon. Hey Erica, c'mon in. How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem? Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up? Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh? Who? Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge. It's not what you think, that was... You told me I was the only one. Alright look, that's it. I do n't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor. Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this? Somebody wan na help me out here? Oh, I know, I know. How, how can you be here and there.' Cause it's a television show. Drake, what're you getting at? I'm not Drake. That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin. Is this true? Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. And then he told me he would run away with me, and he did n't. And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. Is all this true? Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you. Oh Hans. Hans... Hans... Yo evil twin. Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care I'll never forget you Hans. OK, alright, the people who threw the water. Fired! Why? The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs. I ca n't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth? No. I see. Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs. No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur? I'm not saying you have to be Barney. Who's Barney. Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan. You're kidding. This is amazing. I know. I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies. OK, Rachel, I'm ready. OK. Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth? Um, yeah I guess that's me. She's here. Sometimes men love women, sometimes men love men, and then there are bisexuals, though some just say they're kidding themselves. la la - la - la la - la - la - la - la - la - la... This is so exciting, I have n't seen my monkey in almost a year. What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey - is - penis genre? C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon. Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey? I'm sorry guys, closed set. Uh, I'm sorry, you do n't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together. Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper. Ross, there he is.

Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante. Woah, dude, burn. I do n't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday. Hey do n't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all. Now just how big of a star is Marcel? In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard. Woah. So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid. Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set? Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he? The one in the director's chair. Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me. OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you? Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'? We've got a problem. Tell me. I ca n't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche. Is it bad? It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean - Claude Van Damme is gon na be making out with Gabe Kaplan. I'll talk to her. I hate actors. Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost did n't see ya. Excuse me. Ahhhh. Uh, is your name Chandler? Uh, yes, yes it is. Chandler Bing? Do you know me or are you just really good at this game? I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse. Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look... great job growing up. It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it. Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I was n't a pimp. Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants. Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I do n't do that anymore. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. What what what what? Jean - Claude Van Damme. I did n't know he was in this movie, he is so hot. Ya think? The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop? No, was he any good in it? Rachel, he like, totally changed time. Wow, so why do n't you go talk to him? Oh, yeah. What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen? He could hear me. OK, I'm doin' it for ya. Oh Rachel do n't, do n't you dare, do n't, do n't. Tell him I cook. Excuse me. Hi. Hi. Um, this is gon na sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute. You do n't think I'm cute? I, I do n't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her? You can tell her I think her friend is cute. No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows. OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating? OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money. Oh that's me, I got ta go. Oh uh, o, OK. Um, so listen, how many times am I gon na have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date. Well, uh, let's try one more... there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock. I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear. No one was around to hear that? So what'd he say? Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no. Well, thanks anyway. He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking. Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do... Jean - Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you. And then Jean - Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore. Oh man, Drew Barrymore's so smokin, Drew Barrymore has got the greatest set of... no guys around, huh. Does anybody need anything? Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself. That is so unfair. I know. Oh, like you would drink Monica Geller coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme. Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. Trainer's gon na let me have him for a couple of hours. You're blowin' me off for a monkey? Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday. Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons. Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done. Stick a fork what? Like, when you're cooking a steak. Oh, OK, I do n't eat meat. Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done? Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell. OK, then, eat me, I'm done. I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on Susie couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly Susie turns to me and says,' Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?' What did you say? Ahh, I believe my exact words were,' Flaign, en - sten'. I mean I did n't know what to say, how do you know if you wan na do it on an elevator? Oh, you just know. Oh, shoot, we got ta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes. Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned should n't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops. Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We got ta go. But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear? Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there. Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner. You want me to wear your panties? Could ya? Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?... You're swell. OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake. Oooh. With mealworms. Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gon na happen here tonight? Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove -. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's got ta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye. OK, Rachel, why do n't you start talking first. Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified. She gave me the green light, I did nothing but -. Do you think I ca n't see you in the TV set? Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share... Ya know, you had no right to go out with Van Damme. That is the most ridiculous. You sold me out. I did not sell you out. Yes you did. Absolutely. Would you let me talk. Did you just flick me? OK, well, you would n't let me finish and I was jus - Ow. That hurt Quit flicking Ow, you stop flicking. You flicked me first. OK, now I'm gon na kick some ass. Ow. Ow. Ow. Alright, now I will let go if you both stop. Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing Van Damme, is that what you want? Uh-huh. You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing Van Damme instead? That's what you want? OK. Oh that's what you want. Yes. Fine. Fine, There we go. You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my bitches. Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys. Forget about it. How you doin there squirmy? I'm hangin in... and a little out. So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities. I have nothing to do with casting.

Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back. I ca n't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean - Claude Van Damme. Can you beat up that guy? Can you beat up that guy? Sure. This is so wild. Ya know, I got ta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date. Normally, I would not do it. Well, what made you make the exception for me?' Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and... Say you're sorry. No. Say it. No. Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it. OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater. Say you're sorry. OK, you wan na play? OK, let's play, let's play. What're you gon na do? You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara. You do n't have the guts. Oh yeah. Well, at least I was n't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute. Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place? Yes that's right. But still, I -, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves. I'll help you fix your sweater. I'll help you throw out your purse. I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing Van Damme. Well, I'm sorry I went out with Van Damme when I knew you liked him. I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves Joey? Ma? Joey! Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off. Oh, no no no, Susie took off with my clothes. Are you naked in there? Not exactly... I'm wearin panties. Huh, you uh, you always wear panties? No, no, this is the first time. Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes. I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them. Well, let me see. No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever. Alright, alright. Woah, someone's flossing. Joey, some people do n't like that. Chandler's wearing panties. What? Let me see. No, no, you do n't have to see. Hi Tushie. Alright, one of you give me your underpants. Ca n't help you, I'm not wearing any. How can you not be wearing any underwear? Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong. Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants. Hi. Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you? I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on. Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie. What happened? One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye. Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right. Oh my God. What? I'm sorry it did n't work out between you and me, or you and me. Drew was very disappointed. OK, well, bye. Goodbye. Well, bye for me too. OK, well, bye - bye again. OK. Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could... Oh, no no no no no. Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt. No no no no. Impressive. But no. Maybe if I were baking. Bye - bye. Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy. You know, I think I want to write a song about all this. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G - string? How long you been waitin' to say that? About 20 minutes.

It's a bracelet. Is n't it? And it's engraved too, check it out. To my best bud. Thanks best bud. Put it on. Oh, now? No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything. You put this on, you're good to go. Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet. I so am. You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life? Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track. Well, this all looks good. Great. And if I want to call for a reference on your last job? Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing. Alright, let s see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad. A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like. No, just a salad will be fine. You got it. Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it. Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce. Uh-huh. Is it dirty? Oh - oh, no no do n't worry, I'm gon na wash it. Do n't, I like it dirty. That's your call. So, uh, what are you going to do next? Well, I thought that I would cut up the tomatos. Are they, uh, firm? They'r alright. You sure they have n't gone bad? You're sure they're not very, very bad? No really, they're OK. You gon na slice them up real nice? Actually, I was gon na do them jullienne. Aaaahhhhhhh. I'm outa here. Y - ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye - bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey? Oh, some guy she met at the movies. Oh really? What uh, what does Casey want with her? Well, I'm guessing he wants to do a little dance... ya know, make a little love... well pretty much get down tonight. I do n't know, I do n't get, I do n't get it, I mean, wh, wh, two months ago Rachel and I were like, this close. Right now, what, I'm takin messages from guys she, Rachel Green meets at the movies? I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service. Hang in there, it's gon na happen. Wha, OK, now how do you know that? Because Rachel Green's your lobster. Oh, Phoebe Buffay's goin' somewhere. C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like... Hey, you feelin' better? Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me. So, do you have any other possibilities? Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I wo n't make rent. Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money. No no no, if I could n't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you. Oh OK. Well then why do n't you, uhh, why do n't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them. Ya know, the man's got a point. What is that sparkly thing? That thing, it's a uhh... yeah it's, it's a little flashy. No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella. Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons. Hi. Hi. Hi darling. So, what's this. Some of your old stuff. Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym. Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room? Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we did n't want to disturb them. Oh, God forbid. Oh, hi Rachel. Hi. Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear. Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see. Well, I ca n't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii. What, what incident? Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Do n't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. Do you want a refill? No, I'm alright, thanks. OK. Ooh, OK, you got ta give me a second, I wan na get this just right. Dude, 11 o'clock, totally hot babe checkin' you out. That was really good, I think I'm ready for my penis now. I know what you're thinking, Dave Thomas, founder of Wendy's. I'm Gail. Chandler. I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you. What? Oh this is excellent. You know he could a gotten me a VCR, Joey Tribbiani could a gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap. It's not that bad. Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you do n't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. Chandler, Chandler. I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that... Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau. That's actually good. Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has Man been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha. I think she's OK. Look at that, look at that, see how Rachel Green's pushing Man away and Man wo n't budge. Alright, I'm gon na do something. Excuse me, are you Rachel? What? I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow. What are you, what are you doin'? Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I do n't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids. Sure will. I've uh, got ta go. Take care. OK, see ya later, nice meeting you. You're welcome. What? I was saving you. Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me? Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh... OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save. But, you are. What? Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster. OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again? No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the tank when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the tank, ya know, with, with the holding and... Uhh, Phoebs you wan na help me out with the, the whole lobster thing? Do the claws again. Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us? Ross, there is no us, OK. No, but... No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it. Well, but, but... NO but Ross. We are never gon na happen, OK. Accept that. E-except, except that what? No, no, ACC - cept that. Oh. Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin? Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say? OK, that's my bad. If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so. Well, does n't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me? Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me? OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we would n't focus on that. Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my... wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. You know what the... I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now... You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there. Hey guys. Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you did n't bring Ben? No, Ben's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today. A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying. Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. Where have you been? Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet? No, but that's probably'cause I have n't asked them yet. C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news. Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I did n't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it. Why? Because they made me. You were fired? What're you gon na do? Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught Monica Geller well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go? In the bank. There you go. So she dips into Monica Geller savings, that's what it's there for. Monica Geller's gon na be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. Anything larger back there? I ca n't believe it. Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay. Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. Hey. I've got something that's gon na make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? Hey now you have two. Oh, now you have two. What am I gon na do, huh? Hey. Hey. How come you have two? Well this one's for you. Get out. No, I ca n't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry, it's about you and me and the fact that we're best buds. Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies. That's what they'll call us. Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like. You have dinosaur checks? Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that? Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful. Hey, Mon, what is this? Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then. Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained.

Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you would n't have done the head tilt. The head tilt? Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt.' How ya doin'? You OK?' I'm sorry. No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the' I'm OK' head bob.' I'm OK.'' You sure?'' Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change. Oh, that's too bad. I'll survive. Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, do n't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller - Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we would n't have to get up. What if we have to pee? I'll cancel the sodas. You've got to get back out there, it's your party. But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists.

You two are totally into each other. Phoebe, Richard Burke's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me. OK, so what, you're just never gon na see Richard Burke again? Not never. I mean, I'm gon na see Richard Burke tomorrow at my eye appointment. Did n't you like, just get your eyes checked? Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age. C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little... hard to follow. I told you there was going to be sub-titles. I know, I just did n't want to wear my glasses on my first date. Monica. It would really help when I'm kissing you if you did n't shout out my sister's name. Honey, I'm just checking. Oh. Monica. Mon. Monica. Mon. What, what. I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry. And that's, that's funny why? Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing. I, I know it's big, I just did n't know it was uh, ha - ha big. OK. OK, my hands were no where near your butt. I know, I know, I know, I know.

Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once. When? When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here. Oh you are so lucky. I know. Woah, woah, woah australopithicus is n't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, homo-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect. Well maybe he was nervous. Oh look, I ca n't believe this. Look, homo-habilus has n't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why do n't, why do n't they just give him a microwave?

You licked and - and you put. You licked and you put. Yeah, so. Well do n't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush. You used my toothbrush? Well, that was only'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain. Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere. Hey, why ca n't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap? Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning. Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash. Hey. Hey. Hey. Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion? Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch. Ahh. OK, ready when you are. Okey - doke. I ca n't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos. Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos? Yes, but you can not tell Ross'cause I want to surprise Ross Geller. Wow, this is wild. What're you gon na get? Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom.' Cause her name's Lily. Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch? So where you gettin' it? I think on my shoulder. What? What's on your shoulder? Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo. A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that? Hi. Hi. Well hey, you do n't - you do n't think they're kind of cool? No, sorry I do n't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it does n't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I do n't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me? Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gon na be here any minute. Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh? Well, Richard's my parents' best friend, he has to be there. Oh, is today the day you're gon na tell them about you two? Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give Ross Geller a stroke. No, I think you should tell them. No, I do n't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything. I do n't know, I do n't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say,' God I hope they get together.' Alright, shall we? OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un -, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up. Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling Richard, they still would n't believe it. We're here. Oh hi kids. Hi darling. Happy birthday dad. Oh thank you. Hi ma. Happy birthday. Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride? Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us. Well, you kids take the train in? No, Richard Burke gave them a ride. Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20 - year - old twinkie in the city. Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom. Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section. Are we still on that? We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin. She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. Can you believe this place? I know, this is a great apartment. Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes. Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously. Hey. Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man. Thanks. You want it? Huh? Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one. Yeah, can you see me in a place like this? Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen. Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK. C'mon, tell us. Yeah, is she really 20. I am not telling you guys anything. C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously. Dad, you really do n't want to do that. Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends? Jack, would you let it go? Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster. Guys. Seriously, it is not like that. Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou... Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence. What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let Richard touch the Porsche. OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily? Well I... I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh. Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me. Here we go. Uh-huh. You're not going? Uh-huh. What? Is it - is this'cause of what Ross said? No. Well, yeah, maybe. I do n't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gon na work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922? What's 1922? Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo? Yes I do, it's just that Ross is... OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you? No. OK, who is the boss of you?!! You? No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!! How ya doin'? I'm a twinkie. Really? I'm a hero. Oh, this is so hard. Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them. Maybe we should just tell your parents first. My parents are dead. God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean... you know what I mean. I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright. Alright. Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you. Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support. Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob does n't believe I have one. I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city? I know. Richard's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon. I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo. Apparently, Richard told Johnny Shapiro that Monica Geller's quite a girl. In fact, Richard told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with Monica Geller. Really. I tell you, I've never seen him this happy. So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model? Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25 - year - olds. Oh Jack stop. C'mon, it's my birthday. Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment. Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it. Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love. Well it would n't kill you to say it once in a while. Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it. What? I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I do n't need a roommate anymore. Woah, woah, woah. I do n't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware. What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie. Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it. Well that's how I feel. Well then maybe you should take it. Well then maybe I will. Fine with me. Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons. Who's drink can I freshen? Almost time for cake. Mon, Mon, are you OK? You remember that video I found of mom and dad? Yeah. Well, I just caught the live show. Eww. Hey there. What? Nothing, I just heard something nice about you. Humm, really? Richard. Richard. Your son is n't seeing anyone is Richard's son? Uhh, not that I know of. Well, I was thinking, why does n't Richard's son give Monica a call? That - that's an idea. Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone. Oh? Oh? Ohh. Monica Geller never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone? Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them are n't. Is that crystal? So, who's the mystery man? Well, uh, Richard's a doctor. A real doctor? No, a doctor of meat. Of course Richard's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and Richard's sweet, and know you'd like Richard. Well that's wonderful... I Mom, it's OK. It is Judy. Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW! Found it. I'll take that dad. It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item. That's impossible, Richard's got a twinkie in the city. Dad, I'm the twinkie. You're the twinkie? She's not a twinkie. Al - alright, l - look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in... Oh please, a relationship. Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man. Really? Yes. Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday? Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier. When did I say that? Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom. Oh that looks so good, oh I love it. I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lem me se yours. Ahh. OK, let's see yours again. Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours. Oh OK. Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I do n't know how - where it went. You did n't get it? No. Why did n't you get it? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea. I know, I know, and I was gon na get it but then Man 1 came in with this needle and uh, di -, did you know they do this with needles? Really? You do n't say, because mine was licked on by kittens. Hey. Hey. Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened... Yeah me too. I know. Yeah. Yeah. So do we need to hug here or... No, we're alright. So I got ya something. Plastic spoons. Great. Lick away my man. These'll go great in my new place. You know,' till I get real ones. What? Well, I ca n't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment. No - no, I mean what, what's this about your new place? I'm movin' out like we talked about. Well I did n't think that was serious. Ya know I thought that was just a fight. Well, it was a fight... based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or... whatever. Well, there you go. Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I do n't want to leave you high and dry. Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there. Woah. Why do you get to keep the table? I did pay for half of it. Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half. Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it. Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass. Your little men are gon na get scored on more times than your sister. Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister? So, are you sorry that I told them? No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running. Oh. Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see. Is Ross here? No he went out to get pizza. Oh really, OK. That's great. Very tasteful. Wan na see mine, wan na see mine? Yes. What? You did n't get one. OK, well then what is this? What're we looking at? That blue freckle? OK, that's my tattoo. That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it. OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven. Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going,' Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. You got a tattoo? Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world. Lem me see. Well? Well it's really... sexy. I would n't have thought it would be but... wow. Really? Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff? I guess. Hey, save us some pizza. Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it. Stop talkin' to your men. Yes! And the table is mine. Congratulations. Hey, you guys are still gon na come visit me, right?

Oh no - no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids could n't even get theirs accross the street.

I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind. But I thought you wanted to live by yourself. I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I do n't have as many thoughts as you'd think. Joey, why do n't you talk to Chandler about moving back? You really think Chandler Bing'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad. I promise you, Chandler Bing would definitely want you back. I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back. But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together. Look, I know you do n't want to hear this right now but, we've seen Joey Tribbiani in his new place, alright. And Joey Tribbiani's happy, he's, Joey Tribbiani's decorated.

No he's, Eddie's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room. Maybe that's because you have n't taken the time to get to know Eddie. Let's remedy that, shall we? We do n't need to remedy that. Oh yeah, it'll be fun. What was that? Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other. Yeah alright, that sounds alright. Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train.

And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I do n't think I'm ever gon na stop. That uh, was n't such a funny story, was it?

Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wan na say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best. Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet. Ok. Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot. Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy. Phoebe's dead. Hi. Hi. I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.

Page 42, page 42, page 42. Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey' new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture. Ooh, I look good. Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines? Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was,' If we do n't get this woman to a hospital, Alex's going to die.' But I made it,' If this woman does n't get to a hospital, she's not gon na live.' Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Are n't you afraid though, that the writers are gon na be kinda mad when they read this? Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that? Makes up most of his lines. Son - of-a -. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed. I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft? Uhh, I do n't know, I just bring the scripts. They ca n't kill me, I'm Francesca's long lost son. Right. Could you sign this? No. No way, I'm not signing that. I do n't think that's gon na affect the plot of the show. How can they do this to me? Er, uh, I'm just gon na go. Sorry. Well it was n't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage. Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious. G'night. Night Richard. Good luck Mon. Alright, before I tell you, uh, why do n't you tell me how many women you've been with. Two. Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you? Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. Barbara was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two. Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gon na go brush my teeth. Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I do n't need the actual number, just a ballpark. Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark. Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now. Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number? Uhhhooo. C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them. Well, there's you. Better not be doin' these in order. Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo. Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini. Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him. Really? Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head. Eddie, I did n't sleep with your ex-girlfriend. That's very interesting, ya know,'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with Eddie's ex-girlfriend would say. This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish tank, and left, end of story. Where's Buddy? Buddy? My fish, Buddy. There was no fish when Eddie's ex-girlfriend dropped it off. Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you kill my fish, my Buddy? Hey I did n't kill your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That ca n't be smart. So we're just gon na take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me? Well yeah. Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet. You really ok with it? Oh honey, I'm fine. Oh, yay. Ok about that two. What? Alright, what about my two? Well, it just seems like a really small number. Right, and... And, well, do n't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat? Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I do n't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with. But you've only slept with two people. Right. Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right. Now I do. Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh. Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why do n't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock - knock jokes. God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was... Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex? Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gon na lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo. Knock - knock. But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had. Until now. Oh, hi. Hi. Richard just told me he loves me. Oh my God, honey that's great. I know. I just ca n't find... Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry. You need one too? Ooooh yeah. There's only one. Monica. Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. Rachel. Hey. Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting. Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different? No. Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat? I have a little comb. Oh. And what do you call that? A moustache comb. Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month. No. Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months. Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan. Agghhh. So were you in Nam? Rock - paper - scissors? Yeah. One two three. Yeesss. Fine, go have sex. No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, could n't feel his legs. No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was... Honey. What, what oh.... Shall we? It's not gon na happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow. Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand... So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes. Why? Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and killed his fish. Why would you kill his fish? Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to kill the fish. Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? Yeah. Wait, he's not here yet. So, he's on the show, he knows what happens. Yeah. Alright. Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way. Oh good. Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother. Oh Drake. Hard day huh? First the medical award, this. Some guys are just lucky I guess. Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat. Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong? No, no, they only said you. Oh, ok. Alright. I love you Drake. Yeah, whatever. Oh no. Drake, look out. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Did they just kill off Joey? No. Now maybe. C'mon. Joey. Open up. We want to talk to you. I do n't feel like talkin. Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you. We're worried about you. And some of us really have to pee. Sorry Joey Hey. Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks. We came over as soon as we saw. How could you not tell us? I do n't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out. Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back. Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin. But Joey, you're gon na be fine. You do n't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera. Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say. Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you wo n't get mildew. What? To me that's nice. It's gon na be ok. You know that? No, I do n't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gon na be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre - approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life. I'm sorry man. Yeah, Joey honey, I do n't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us. No, that means nothin to me. Uhhhaahh. Pecan sandy, just made em. Yeah alright. What're these, raisins? Uh, sure, why not. Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling? I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you. Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cracker. What's you point man? Ok, good night. You big freak of nature. Hey. Hey.

Daahh!! What're you doin' here? Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep. Why? Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh - heh, please. I ca n't sleep now. You want me to sing? No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now. Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man. Hannibal Lecter... better roommate than you. No. See now I do n't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you do n't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh? I did n't realize that. Yeah. GET OUT NOW!! Ok, you really want me out? Yes please. Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out. I want you out. No no no, I wan na hear it from your lips. Where did you hear it from before? Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow. I heard that. Hey. Hey. Hey. Whe - ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh? Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at' em and I though, you know what I do n't have? A mirror? Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty. Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood. Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's got ta have some kind of cache. Cache? Jaunty? Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gon na get some coffee. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oooh, so so so, did you read the book? Oh my God, it was incredible. Did n't it like totally speak to you? Woah, woah, woah, what book is this? Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered. Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it. Men just take out wind? Ya - huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers. Wow. Yeah. Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit. It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard. Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind. No. No,'cause he's yummy. Yes. But all the other ones. Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip. Anybody want a croan. Ok, this is a typical lightning - bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um,' Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?' Do n't worry about it already. Things happen. So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything? Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth? No, can we get back to me? Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World. Alright. Cab driver number two? You're welcome. But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab? Things change, roll with em. But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gon na do this. Joey, I'm gon na tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and do n't make on the floor. I'm sorry. See ya. Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so. Is n't it. Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called' Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'. I do n't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you. Hey you guys. Hey. Uh, sweetie we've got ta go. NO! No? No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table? Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you do n't miss the beginning. No, see this is n't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. You go girl. I ca n't pull that off can I? Excuse me, your, your, your wind? Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you wo n't let me blow? You, you know I, I do n't, have a - have a problem with that. Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry. Um - um, um - um. You're right, I do n't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit! What is it? I, I do n't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I do n't really get it but she's, Ross' date's pretty upset about it. See, this is why I do n't date women who read. Uh-oh. What, what's that? It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That ca n't be good. Open it, open in. Oh my God. Woah. Look at this, how did I spend so much money? Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due. Ahh. What, woah, woah, $ 3500 at porcelain safari? My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, Man 1 spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I do n't know what I'm gon na do. Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World. What? That audition. That's a two line part. Joey, you owe $ 1100 at I Love Lucite. So what. So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money. Hey, look, I do n't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic. Toilet paper? Yeah. Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic. Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend. I am your friend. Well then tell me things like,' Joey you'll be fine,' and,' Hang in there,' and, and,' Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.' But I do n't know it. What I do know is that you owe $ 2300 at Is n't it Chromantic. Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe. Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gon na be till you get another. Look, I do n't wan na hear this right now. Huh, I'm just saying... Well do n't just say. Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go. Ok. Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok. I do n't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gon na happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there? Hey pal. Ahhhh - gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here? Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic! Look Eddie, are n't you forgetting anything? Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one. Maybe'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, is n't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now? Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac! Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time... Ah - ah - ah, you know what that is? Your last roommate's kidney? That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display. Hey Gunther, let me get a lemonade to go. Lemonade? You ok man? Ah, it's career stuff. I do n't know if you heard but they killed off my character on the show. Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it? I fell down an elevator shaft. That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche. What? I used to be Bryce on All My Children. Daaahhhh! Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh! Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching. I wa - Uuuh. Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons. Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out. What? You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT! You, you want, you want me to move out? Uh-huh. I uh, I got ta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean do n't you think? This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue. Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack! You want some help. No help required Chico. All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gon na cost you about so bucks. Excuse me, that's 50 bucks. What? Five oh dollars. Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. That's great. And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims'cause I have a background in medical acting. Ok, listen, thanks for coming in. No no, uh, do n't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there were n't ya. I'll have a good day. Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no. And I would have to say pah - huh. What? Do you not remember the puppet guy? Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power. And his puppet too. Yeah ok, well at least I did n't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date. Who? Paul. Oh. Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30. Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29. Not uh, not to my recollection. Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me. Only'cause you took up half the circle. Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gon na be going to the goddess meetings alone. Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica. One hour? You are such a leaf blower. Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3 - D last supper, Judas is a little loose. Oh my God, what's goin' on? They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right. No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you do n't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey. Thanks Ross. Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I ca n't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition. I went. Great, how did it go? I did n't get it. Good for you. What? You're livin' the dream. Huh? All right then. Oh, not my parrot. What? I ca n't watch this. Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird? 1200. Dollars?

I'll take it. My gift to you man. Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though... I'll take the dog though. Here are your cakes. We did n't order cake. No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other. You're right. You know. I love you goddesses. I do n't ever want to suck your wind again. Thank you. So are we good? We're good. We're good? Yeah. Ok, let me take these cakes back'cause they're gon na take that out of my paycheck. Ding dong, the psycho's gone. Are you sure this time? Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD! Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's. There is no alley behind Macy's. So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gon na make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal? Our next cocktail party? Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick. Eddie, do you remember yesterday? Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it. Do you remember talking to me yesterday? Uh, yes. So what happened? We took a road trip to Las Vegas man. Oh sweet Moses. So on this road trip, did you guys win any money? Naah, I crapped out, but Mr. 21 over here he cleans up, 300 bucks, check it out he buys me these new shoes, sweet huh? Nice. Yeah. Well see ya upstairs. See ya pals.

Absolutely. What happened to the foosball? Ah that's a cantelope. Hey look, are we gon na have to bring this out every time Ross comes over? He paid a lot of money for it. I'm gon na hold him a different way. Look I do n't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place? Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky. So is he housetrained or is he gon na leave little bathroom tiles all over the place?

Watcha guys doin? Monica's making us watch Old Yeller. Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie. What? What're you talkin' about? C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun. Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end? What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy? That's not the end. Yu - huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say' The end'. What about the part where he has rabies? He does n't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said. Uh, Phoebe, I do n't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen. What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the gun. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END. Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?... Actually, nothing but rubber gloves. Ya know, one of these times you're gon na really be naked and we're not gon na come over. Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing. Well, how do you find clothes that fit? Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question. Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I do n't look. No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket. Yeah, Ross ca n't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking.' Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?' Ok. Hey, why do n't you ask Richard? Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick? Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan. Ok, that's Eric. Glad to be of help. Matches. I meant, why do n't you take Richard to the game? What? I do n't know. C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh. I do n't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we do n't know Richard really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old - er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings. So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car? Ok, this could be tough. Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring Richard, but only if he takes the Jaguar. Ooh, you almost had it. No no, you're fine, you're fine. Hello Hi. Hey. Hi honey. Oh you guys are not gon na believe what happened. What? What? Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and Ben grabs the table and Ben pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it. Uhh, we know, Ben already did it last week. You can watch our tape if you want. I do n't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has Ben spoken yet, is Ben driving, does he have a favorite liquour? Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He ca n't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen. Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want Ben for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen, I mean, I feel like - Great. That would be fine. Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared. Oh shout, that would have been fun. Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? Ben just waved, Ben just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes Ben has. Very good. Hey. Hey Phoebs, what cha got there? Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment. Wow, all you need now is The Killing Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay. Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before Lily Buffay killed herself. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Where is Richard, where's Richard? Did you ditch him? Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave Richard a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car. So'd you guys have fun? Your boyfriend is so cool. Really? Yeah, Richard let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15. Wow, he must like you the best. Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this. Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats. You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car. No problem. Hey Chandler I think they get it. Ok. There's the man. He - he - eyy. Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gon na keep this by the way. Ok. Richard kept my dollar. So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gon na do? Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg. Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there. Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg. Think I better go before mommy starts weeping. Buy mommy. We love you. Buy. Have a good time. Ok, Ben. Ross. Yeah. Look. Joey, do you know we can see you from here? How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula. You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard. Not like him, per-se, just not un-like Richard. Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler. Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know. So Joey, why did n't you grow a moustache? Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, Chandler Bing got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks. Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine. Hey listen, we've got ta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs. You're meeting Richard? Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game. Yeah, did n't he tell ya? Well, Richard told me he was going out with the guys, I just did n't know that you were the guys. You hear that? We're the guys. We're the guys. With that moustache does n't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia? Thank you. Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da - da. Da - da. Can you say da - da? Look, I'm gon na tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try. No luck huh? Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah - condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold Ben for a sec,'cause I, I got ta take this off. Oh, yeah sure, Ok. What're you doing? Uh, I'm holding Ben. Yeah, well, Ben's a baby not a bomb. Ok. Well just hold Ben like you'd hold a football. This is how I would hold a football. Ok, here, here. There we go. Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I have n't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one. It's alright, it's no big deal. Really? Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. What? What? You think about stuff like that? Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. Two, two babies? Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here wo n't feel too competitive. Then what's gon na happen? Well, we wo n't wan na raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale. Uh-huh. Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we do n't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what. Huh? I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this and um, I am gon na go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I do n't have a pot. I do n't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? Hey. Hey Phoebs, what's happening? Oh, ok, murder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes. So you watched the movies huh? Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no,'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies. Charlotte who? With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud. Alright, you wan na feel better? Yeah. Ok, here, watch this. It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this. So you ca n't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in. Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gon na see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease. Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Did n't you kinda see it coming? Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity. Hey, big guy, game time. Hey, be right there. There's a game? Uh, yeah, I just got my pick - up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel. It's the basketball playoffs. Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you do n't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other. Oh, no, honey, I mean, do n't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they do n't start sentences with,' You know who just died shoveling snow?' Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks. Uh, it's the college playoffs. Oh, then go Vassar. Uh, they're not in it. Ok, then just go. Ok. Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I do n't wan na be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wan na spend 24 hours a day with them. Sure. It's just that he does n't have that much free time, ya know, and I do n't know, what do I do? Does it matter? You're ultimately just gon na die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off. Aghh. Me too. I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys. Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century. Ya know what, I think I'm gon na go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles. Ok, what the hell happened back there? I do n't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes. Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders. Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks. C'mon, what, you never think about our future? Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gon na sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gon na have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gon na be. You know what our childrens names are gon na be. No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good. What was the book? The big book of childrens' names. Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing. Yeah. But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gon na have to deal with that. Ok fine. Thank you. We're not done. I did n't know that. Ok, then you're gon na have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gon na stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gon na end up together and if that scares you, tough,'cause you're gon na have to deal with that. Fine, I will. Good,'cause I love you. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well I love you too. Well that's the first time we've said that. Yes it is. Well, I'm gon na kiss you. Well you better. Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip. Did you like it? Oh yeah. You know, I do n't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but do n't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? I did n't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, \" It's a sucky life and just when you think it ca n't suck any more it does. \" Kick save and... denied. But... Richard gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that shot BE any prettier? Man you are incredible. Well, we had a table in college. Oh really, I did n't know they had foosball in the 1800's. Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gon na kick in. Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table. Ok, just one more point. Score! Now can we go? See, that's why we do n't let her play. Is everything all right? Um - hmm. Uh-oh. Oh hey listen, do n't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time. Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with. Well. No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads. I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just - ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here. Uh, you guys see me as a dad? Oh yeah. No. Nooooo. Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal. Uh-huh, yeah. No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work. That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gon na go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around. Nighty - nite. You're not a dad. You're not a dad. Not a dad. I ca n't believe you got us into trouble. So are you ok? Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys. Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball. What're you talkin' about, I was killin'' em. Yeah, well they suck too. Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail. Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper does n't make this process any cuter. Hello. It's us. Come on up. I'm gon na get the rest of his stuff together. Ok, we can do this now, ca n't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can. There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi. Hi. I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said' Hi'. Wha, what? Ben just said hi. What, the word hi? Ye -, no, my Uncle Hi. Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything. Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him. Hello. Guess what. Ben just said his first word. What did he say? Something about hi. That's so exciting. Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi. You know, actually it's more like, hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Ok, this could go on for a while. We've got a cab waiting downstairs. Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him. Tuesday. Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys. Take care. Bye Ben. Bye. Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me. Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college. We've got ta go, we've got that cab waiting. Alright, alright, ok. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, is n't this a nice hole here. Hey. Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and ca n't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost. Oh, I'm so glad you're here. \n","None\n","None\n","Old Yeller: [Old Yeller, Old Yeller, Yeller]\n","Old Yeller: [Old Yeller, Old Yeller, Yeller]\n","None\n","Old Yeller: [Old Yeller, Old Yeller,

Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting. Ok honey, you really need a job. Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview. Really. Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there. On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh. No,'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet... which is my father's last name. Ahh. And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken. His indian name? No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I do n't think so. Freakish. Wow. Freaky. Weird, weird. Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger? Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him. Why? Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist. Man, I am so beat. Oh yeah. Hey, you just wan na forget about raquetball and hang out here? Yeah alright. Hey you're in our seats. Oh, sorry we did n't know. Hey, we were sitting there. Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it? Is that supposed to be funny? No actually, I was just going for colorful. What's with this guy? What's with you? Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee. What just happened? I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat. That, that is funny. Can I have it back? No. No? No. Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat. Why should we? Because it's a special hat. See he bought it'cause Chandler Bing was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler... Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat? You got a problem with that? No, just wan na make sure we're on the same page. Hey, how'd the interview go? It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries? So do n't do it. How can I not do it? I have $ 127 in the bank. Monica, relax, go get a beer. I do n't want a beer. Who said it was for you? Hhhiiii. What's the matter with you? The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat. Noo. You're kiddin'. It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff is n't supposed to happen anymore. Oohhh. Hi. Hi. Ohhh Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one. Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back. Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now. Hey, I went up. What? My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $ 127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have... a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gon na do it. Do what? Put all my money in me. Monica, what are you talking about? You do n't know the first thing about the stock market. What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan... yeah telephone number of the stock... selling store. See, did n't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea? Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gon na say' Hi birthfather'. We love you, we're here for you. Yeah good luck, good luck. Thanks. Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich? Ohh, what is in that? Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo. No no,'cause mayo, that would make it gross. Hey, hey, no, oh oh. Run Phoebe run. No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wan na love all animals, please no. Get him a bone, get a bone. You got ta bone? Are you kidding me? Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap. Ok, alright, we have a problem. Well why do n't you just reach out and take his trampoline. Ok, here, I know what we can do. Hey, hey, hey no. Ok, doggie get the - aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie. Good doggie get the sandwich, get the... ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say? Well if he's not gon na eat it, I will. Are you crazy? Phoebs, he's just a little dog. Ahhh. Hey. What? Do you have to be a Century 21 real - estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets? Do you say this stuff to girls? Hehehehey, is n't that the guy who used to wear your hat? And look where they're sitting. You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door. Maybe we did n't make it clear enough. Yeah. This couch belongs to us. Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to. You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here. Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. Gunther, these guys are trying to take our seat. Fellas, these guys were here first. Oh, sorry, I did n't realize. Sorry. There you go. Thank you Gunther. We did n't want to have to go and do that. Ross Geller told on us? You told on us? Well pal, you did n't give me much of a choice. Do n't play with his things. I know. Alright, let's take this outside. Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that? The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that. You had to ask. Yeah. Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gon na fight you guys. Well then here's the deal, you wo n't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again. I think you played the Gunther card too soon. Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go. Yeah, I do n't know. What's the matter? I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gon na be around forever, despite what Phoebe's grandmother says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I do n't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right. Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand. Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wan na go home? Ok, thanks. Sorry, again What was that? Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now. I wan na buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wan na buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo. Time is money my friend? Yeah, you missed,' Takes money to make money,' and uh,' Do n't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.' Hey, I made $ 17 before breakfast, what have you done? Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $ 3.50. How did you make $ 17. Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY. How come those? Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy. What happened to uh, MEG.? MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down. That is so not my motto. Hey. Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog? Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, Guy 1 said that the little fella's gon na be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow. Good. Oh, thank God. Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and Guy 1 said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so... still hoping. Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gon na call your dad and let Frank Buffay know that his dog is ok? I, I do n't wan na meet my father over the phone. What am I gon na say, like' Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.' Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it. Ok. Listen, just do n't say anything about me, ok. DO N'T... be too long with the phone. Phoebe Buffay'll be a much better friend when the market closes. It's a woman. So talk to Miss Buffay. Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. Why the voice. Hard to say. Your cappucino sir. Thank you. Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house. Absolutely. How come it's not mixing with the water? Well the package says you have to uh, constantly keep it moving. Stir and drink, stir and drink, never let it settle. Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there. Ok. No. No? No. Man I do n't wan na have to have Joey with me every time I wan na descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I do n't wan na spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a' K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys. Alright, hang on a second there Custer. Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before? Yeah, sure. By someone besides Monica? No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'. Well, could n't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. What? Hi, welcome home. I need to borrow a hundred bucks. For what? I've got ta get back in the game. Why, when did you get out of the game? I do n't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it. Oh no. Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too. Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry. Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks? I, I do n't have it. But I need it. Otherwords I'm gon na have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I do n't wan na have to wear flame retardant boobs. Nobody does honey. Hi. Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog? It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. Phoebe Buffay's a vegetarian. What are these, stitches? Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you ca n't let him look up too long'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast. Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him. Sure, oh, is, is Frank home. How do you know Frank? Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here? Yeah. Frank. Yeah. What? Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior. Frank Buffay went out for groceries. Ok so will he be back soon? Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now. Alright, I'm, I'm gon na go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry. Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad? Um well I do n't really. Just genetically. Frank Buffay's kinda my dad too. Heavy. Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe? No but he did n't really talk about anything. Oh. Except stilts. Stilts? Yeah, Frank Buffay loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and Frank Buffay was waving'cause Frank Buffay was always happiest when Frank Buffay was on his stilts. Wow. Yeah. I do n't know what to do with that. Me neither. So you're like my big sister. Yeah. This is huge, you can buy me beer. I'm not gon na. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say,' Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.' I got ta friend named Mark. That'll work too. Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'. Yeah, that'd be ok. Alright. Ok, I'm in the book. Ok, yeah. Alright. So um, stilts huh? Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter. Ok. Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take? Would you come on! Come on! Thank you. Ah, there we go. I think we proved our point. You burn your mouth? Can not feel my tounge. Bullies, big bullies. Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies. Did we not make ourselves clear the other day. Yes, and that's why we're here. Yes, we're standing out ground... apparently. Let's do this alright. Woah, ho - ho, whad'ya got there, a weapon? It's a nice watch, I do n't wan na break it on your ribs. Alright, let's do this. Alright. Question. If I do n't care about my watch, can I use it as a weapon? Whad'ya mean? Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it. No, you ca n't use your watch. Ok. Or your keys. Ok. Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright. Alright, c'mon man, let's do this. Before I forget, are we hitting faces? Of course we're hitting faces, why would n't you hit faces? Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation. Actually, you know, uh, I got ta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea. Ok, nothing from the neck up. Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating. Oh really, you guys tryin' again? Yeah. Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle? C'MON! Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh. Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! Hey. Hey. God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt.

Ohhh. What? Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things? You wan na be in charge of the food committee? Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees? Really. Why ca n't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun? Yeah. Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are. Alright. If you guys do n't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want. Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See honk honk. Wow, it's, it's like porno for clowns. I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come. Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper. Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper. Why not Shannon Cooper? Cause Shannon Cooper uh, Shannon Cooper steals stuff. Or maybe Shannon Cooper does n't steal stuff and Joey just slept with Shannon Cooper and never called her back. Joey that is horriable. Hey I liked Shannon Cooper, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I do n't know I guess I just got scared. I'm sorry, I did n't know. I did n't think anyone'd buy that, ok. Hi honey, how did it go? Agh, it was the graduation from hell. Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica. So what happened? My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. Ok, so I guess we do n't invite Rachel Green parents. Well, how bout just her mom? Why her mom? Cause I already invited her. Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth? Oh no, ca n't invite her. She also steals. Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake? Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. Excuse me? It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert. Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo. Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here? What? The father ca n't drop by to see the daughter on Rachel Green birthday? No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that Rachel Green's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye - bye. Ohhh, you're having a parteee. No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey. I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it? This is n't your first surprise party, is it sir? Hi Monica. Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus. So, basically just a Chinese guy. Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why do n't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed. Alright, that sounds like a two person job. Well, my goodness, what was that? Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just were n't ready for you yet. You thought I was Rachel? Yes because uh, you look so young. And because you're both, you know, white women. Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom? NO! No, I'll take that for ya. Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you. Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons... The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was... Ha - ha, that's great, ha - ha. I ca n't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do? Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr -, oh, ok we can come back out in the living room. So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place. Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again? Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area. Right this is staging. Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area. This is clearly in the wrong apartment. Alright you guys are off to party number one and you, you are off to party number two Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin. Chandler could you at least send some women to my party? Alright that's Ross. Ok, they're coming, shhh. Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner. Thanks for being born. Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you. Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok. Now I love you even more. Surprise. Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great. Happy birthday sweetie. Wow you, you. I had no idea. Really? No, I knew. All right. Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall. What? What? Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now. Why. Just go. Surprise. Happy birthday sweetpea. Daddy. Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here? Well, we could count again. I ca n't believe this is happening. You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put' em all together and if they ca n't deal with it, who cares. I do. That's who. Look, are you gon na be ok? Well, I have to be, I do n't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes. Well, actually just one birthday flan. What? It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert... Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee. Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said,' I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party. Quick volleyball question. Volleyball. Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you did n't really like that grey lamp, did you? Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you. Dennis. Ok, that's me. Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gon na go talk to mom for a while. Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers? Uhh, let's just stay clear of' I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok. Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out. Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery.... game? It's not a game Ross, a woman died on my table today. I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead. Listen you guys, I do n't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wan na push the caps until you hear them click. Gunther, where're you going? I um, was sorta thinking about maybe... No. No you ca n't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker. Listen if you wan na go, just go. No, she'll yell at me again. Alright, I can get you out. What? Shh. In a minute, I'm gon na create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and do n't look back. I think I need a drink. Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want? Scotch. Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass. Neat. Cool. No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks. I know. Oh hello Ross, where have you been? Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse. Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink. Oh, mine too. Is n't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me? Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister? I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket. No. no. Whad'ya mean no? No, um, see'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir. Get my glasses too. All righty roo. What a great moment to say that for the first time. Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is,' Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny. Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster? What? I do n't see anything. Great, I'm seeing water rings again. Ross, whose glasses are those? Mine. You wear bi-focals? Um - hmm. I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals. Did you know my husband has glasses just like that? Well those are very popular frames. Neil Sedaka wears them. I hear you can get people out of here. Rachel, you did n't tell me your boyfriend smoked. Yeah, like a chimney. Ohh, big smoker. Big big smoker. In fact I'm gon na go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. Are you wearing my glasses? Yes. I was just warming up the earpieces for you. Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes? Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip. Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute. What about my friend Victor? No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious. Alright, let me just get my coat. There is n't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door. Is it true they have beer? Everything you've heard is true. Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament. You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And Gunther! What are you doing here? Um Ok, welcome to the fu - oh. Phoebe. Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go. Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... You want me to see a therapist? Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father. Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I got ta go, I got ta go do a thing. Did you know your mother spent $ 1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place. Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wan na hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff. You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat. You work and you work and you work on a boat... He always ridiculed my pottery classs...... and you sand it and you varnish it...... but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs.... and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...... the scotch and the cigarettes...... and the bansai's and the chiuaua...... I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...... what the hell does she want with half a boat... Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins. Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor. This is it, is n't it? I mean, this is what my life is gon na be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. Mrs. Greene gets the house, Mr. Greene's in some condo my sister's gon na decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this? Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July. Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made Mrs. Greene hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just... I, I know. Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun. Alright, Monica dear, I'm gon na hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem. Ok will do. So glad you came. I think I saw Rachel out in the hall. Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye. Oh ok. Happy birthday sweetie. Ok. Ahh, you drive safe. Ross, what're you doing. I'm getting ready for the water skiing. How are you doing? Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going? To get my coat. No no no. Alright, alright, I can get my own coat. Sorry, we're on a major flan high. Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out. Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe. I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you. Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway. Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene. Well, ok, you take care. Oh, you kids Well, this is the best party I've been to in years. Thank you. Ok everybody, it's time for flan. Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun. Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection. Ok, that's enough. Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish. Ok, I've got one.

Oh, I ordered mine first. Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster... Give it to me. No. Give it to me. Ok, you can have it. There you go, enjoy your coffee. That was there when I got here. Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York. Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow. Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy. You went out with a guy in the Navy? Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy'cause he did n't have any change. Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? No. No, Ryan is my submaring guy. Ryan resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay. So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time? That'll teach you to lick my muffin. Hiii. Oh no, what happened? Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox. Oh no. Yeah, so if you have n't already had it, chances are you're gon na get it. Well I've had it. Yeah, I've had it. Had it. Had it. Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out. Oh look! Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you do n't have to do that. This is n't camp. Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown. Monica... Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town? Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown. What're you doing? Just waiting for you sweetie. Are you remaking the bed? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine. Then, you're redoing it because... If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy. You're pretty much running that risk either way. Ok, you see, the tag should n't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner. Oh, well that's not so crazy. I'm just easing you in. Oh, alright. Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You do n't love me any more do you. Actually, if it's possible, I love you more. Really? Wow, well then come on, I wan na show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point. Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor. But do n't you need experience for a job like that? It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor. Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections. Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor. No kidding. Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call. Where do you work? Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more. I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group. Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, do n't touch his sandwiches. Ha - ha - ha... Ha - ha. Are all you processors dorks? Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you. You look fabulous honey, you really do. Yeah? Are you sure, really. You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights. I, I, I'm hideous. It's gon na be ok. Ryan's been under water. Ryan's just gon na be so glad that you do n't have barnicles on your butt. Come in. Hey baby, I'm back... Hey Ryan, what's up? What's goin' on? Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox. Chicken or small? Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian. Why are n't you at home in bed?' Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have,'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are. I'm sorry, I never had' em. Ohh, ohh. If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub Jimmy Hauser all over my face. Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I did n't have them now. Can I please see your face? Nope. You do n't want to see a face covered with pox. Your face could be covered with lochs, I would n't care. And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary. Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely. I hate this.' Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this. Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gon na let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had. Hey. Hey, how's the first day goin'? Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column. Well there you go. Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie. Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie? Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh? Weird world. Your kids? I figure my character has kids. Ya know there is n't a part of that sentence I do n't need explained. Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does. Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes. Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did. Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there. You know what makes the itching even worse? That you do n't stop talking about it. Fine. Let's just play, ok. Good, ok. Here we go, double sixes, here we go... Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice... What're you doing? Are you scratching? No. This is what I do for luck, ok. You're scratching. Give me the dice. No. Give me the dice. No. Here. There. Ooh, double sixes. We ca n't scratch. You know we ca n't, we'll scar. Uhh, I ca n't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wan na grab all these houses and rub' em all over my body. No. Give it. No. Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. Oh God help me. Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder. Oh, stop that, stop that right now. You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a military man. You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it. Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gon na have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better. Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie. Bye bye Joey. What a phony. Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas. Sir. Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gon na receive the systems report until next Friday? Well the people in my group wan na spend the holiday weekend with their families. I have a family, I'm gon na be here. Yeah Bing, what's that about? It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wan na see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday. Rough numbers? This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas. Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday. Uh, if you say so sir. Joseph's good, is n't Joey Tribbiani? Well, I'm going to kill you. Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers. Why? Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', Joey Tribbiani'll call you on it.' What're you tryin' to pull,' Joey Tribbiani'll say. Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too? This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands. You're strict. It's for their own good. You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time. Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Do n't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular? If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle. Very good. Thank you. You know what. Tomorrow I'm gon na do your clocks. You're gon na do what to my clocks. I'm gon na set them to my time. Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time. No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wan na know why? Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen. No forget it, I'm not gon na tell you now. No come on. Come on tell me. No. See you do n't understand. Come on. No. You do n't have any of these cute little obsessive things. No that's not true. That is not true. Oh yeah. Yeah. Alright, well tell me one of yours. Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks. What if they get mixed up? Boy I would just uh, I would freak out. You would not. I ca n't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I ca n't believe my boyfriend does n't have a thing. My boyfriend does n't have a thing. See, if anyone overheard that, I did n't come off well. Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you. Why? Wh - wh - why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?' Cause Mr. Douglas has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project. Wha - wh - why, why, why does Mr. Douglas suspect that? Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know. Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gon na have to let both of you go. What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph. I do n't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think Joey Tribbiani's a brown - nosing suck up. Oh yeah. Well you ca n't fire Joseph. You know why,'cause Joey Tribbiani's not in your department. Alright, ok, alright. So I ca n't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife. Karen. Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did. Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man. Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer. Really? No freakshow, she's fictional. Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else. Thank you. It's just that, I, I'm gon na miss Joseph. I liked Joey Tribbiani. His wife, Karen was hot. Can I please take these off? I swear I wo n't scratch. No sorry hon, Monica's orders. Well that was n't easy. Ok, dinner's on. And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gon na be hot but that should n't be a problem for you. Alright you kids, bye now. Bye. Oh look, a low budget puppet show. It's such a shame you ca n't see which finger I'm holding up. Wine? Please. Oh, I spilled some. I got it. I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight. What? Sorry. You look beautiful. Oh. You know what, that's it, that's it. Monica, wake up. Monica. What's up? I thought of a thing. Yeah? Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed. No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed. Or so I would have you believe. No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed. Hey come on, you have n't heard my reason yet. Alright, go on. Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side. Oh my God, you're a freak. Yeah. How' bout that. So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to? I really ca n't say. So do you have like any nuclear weapons on board? I ca n't say. Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys. I'm sorry, but I ca n't say. Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines. I better get out of here, I'm gon na miss my flight. Ok, I'll walk you out. Bye Ryan. Pleasure. It was nice to meet you. Take care. So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things? You like that do ya? Oh yeah. I'll make some calls. Ok. Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together? I know. We did n't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. Taxi. Bye you. Oh I'm sorry, we're clo -... Hey sailor. Is this what you had in mind? I'll say. I'm shipping out tomorrow. Well then uh, we better make this night count. Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine. Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse. Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light. Alright you know, why do n't I just meet you upstairs. \n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","None\n","Ryan: [Ryan, Ryan, he, Ryan, Ryan, he, this guy]\n","None\n","the Navy: [the Navy, the Navy,

Paul's just some guy I work with! C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's got ta be something wrong with Paul! All right Joey, be nice. So does Paul have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece? Wait, does he eat chalk? Just,' cause, I do n't want her to go through what I went through with Carl - oh! Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and - not having sex. Sounds like a date to me. Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked. Oh, yeah. Had that dream. Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there. Instead of...? That's right. Never had that dream. No. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I do n't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. And they were n't looking at you before?! Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very - very weird, because - she never calls me! Hi. This guy says hello, I wan na kill myself. Are you okay, sweetie? I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. Ohh. Let me get you some coffee. Thanks. Ooh! Oh! No, no do n't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? Fine! Be murky! I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy. No you do n't. No I do n't, to hell with Carol Willick, she left me! And you never knew Carol Willick was a lesbian... No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? Carol Willick did n't know, how should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud? I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well. Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \" I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren. \" was what? A wrong number? Sorry. Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! I do n't want to be single, okay? I just... I just - I just wan na be married again! And I just want a million dollars! Rachel?! Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you were n't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are! Can I get you some coffee? De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and - you remember my brother Ross? Hi, sure! Hi. So you wan na tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden - Sweet' n' Lo? - I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me : how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering' Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just did n't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. Who was n't invited to the wedding. Ooh, I was kinda hoping that would n't be an issue... \n","Now I'm guessing that Man 1 bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. Tuna or egg salad? Decide! I'll have whatever Christine is having. Daddy, I just... I ca n't marry Barry! I'm sorry. I just do n't love him. Well, it matters to me! If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off. Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants. I say push Woman 1 down the stairs. Push Woman 1 down the stairs! Push Woman 1 down the stairs! Push Woman 1 down the stairs! C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me,' You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said,' What if I do n't wan na be a shoe? What if I wan na be a - a purse, y'know? Or a - or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha - It's a metaphor, Daddy! You can see where he'd have trouble. Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica... Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I do n't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!! Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things... Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and - something with mittens... La la la la... something and noodles with string. These are a few... I'm all better now. I helped! Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole,' hat' thing. And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot. Joey, stop hitting on Rachel Green! It's her wedding day! What, like there's a rule or something? Please do n't do that again, it's a horrible sound. It's, uh, it's Paul. Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz Paul in! Who's Paul? Paul the Wine Guy, Paul? Maybe. Joey : Wait. Your' not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy? Paul finally asked you out? Yes! Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment. Rach, wait, I can cancel... Please, no, go, that'd be fine! Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay? That'd be good... Really? No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy! What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? Hi, come in! Paul, this is..... everybody, everybody, this is Paul. Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey! I'm sorry, I did n't catch your name. Paul, was it? Okay, umm - umm, I'll just -- I'll be right back, I just got ta go ah, go ah... A wandering? Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds. Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That ca n't be good. Hey, Paul! Yeah? Here's a little tip, Monica Geller really likes it when you rub Monica Geller neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red. Shut up, Joey! So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight? Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing! Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your - - big lizards... Anyway, if you do n't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture. Yes, and we're very excited about it. Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gon na hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day. Okay, sure. Hey Pheebs, you wan na help? Oh, I wish I could, but I do n't want to. \n","I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and - I can not feel my legs. I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here. It's a beautiful thing. What's this? I would have to say that is an' L' - shaped bracket. Which goes where? I have no idea. Done with the bookcase! All finished! This was Carol's favorite beer. Carol Willick always drank it out of the can, I should have known. Hey - hey - hey - hey, if you're gon na start with that stuff we're outta here. Yes, please do n't spoil all this fun. Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV - what did you get? You guys. Oh, God. You got screwed. Oh my God! \n","Oh my God! I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when Paul's ex-girlfriend started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get? My brother's going through that right now, Ross Geller's such a mess. How did you get through it? Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say Paul's ex-girlfriend - - leg? That's one way! Me, I - I went for the watch. You actually broke Paul's ex-girlfriend watch? Wow! The worst thing I ever did was, I - I shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel. Ooh, steer clear of you. That's right. \n","I'm divorced! I'm only 26 and I'm divorced! Shut up! You must stop! That only took me an hour. Look, Ross, you got ta understand, between us we have n't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento. You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we do n't do it! I do n't think that was my point! You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman - and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman - for her... What are you talking about?' One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lem me tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get' em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon! I honestly do n't know if I'm hungry or horny. Stay out of my freezer! \n","Ever since Paul's ex-girlfriend walked out on me, I, uh... What?..... What, you wan na spell it out with noodles? No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation. Oh, so there is gon na be a fifth date? Is n't there? Yeah... yeah, I think there is. - What were you gon na say? Well, ever - ev -... ever since Paul's ex-girlfriend left me, um, I have n't been able to, uh, perform.... Sexually. Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry... It's okay... I know being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long? Two years. Wow! I'm - I'm - I'm glad you smashed her watch! So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?... Yeah. Yeah, I do. \n","Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words' Billy, do n't be a hero' mean anything to you? Great story! But, I uh, I got ta go, I got a date with Andrea -- Angela -- Andrea... Oh man, Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats. Right. Thanks. It's June. I'm outta here. Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to - to ask a woman out,... who am I gon na ask? \n","Is n't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life. That is amazing. Congratulations. Y'know, I figure if I can make coffee, there is n't anything I ca n't do. If can invade Poland, there is n't anything I ca n't do. Listen, while you're on a roll, if you feel like you got ta make like a Western omelet or something... Although actually I'm really not that hungry... Oh good, Lenny and Squigy are here. Morning. Good morning. Morning. Morning, Paul. Hello, Paul. Hi, Paul, is it? Thank you! Thank you so much! Stop! No, I'm telling you last night was like umm, all my birthdays, both graduations, plus the barn raising scene in Witness. We'll talk later. Yeah. Thank you. That was n't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date? Shut up, and put my table back. Okayyy! All right, kids, I got ta get to work. If I do n't input those numbers,... it does n't make much of a difference... So, like, you guys all have jobs? Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff. Yeah, I'm an actor. Wow! Would I have seen you in anything? I doubt it. Mostly regional work. Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio, at the little theater in the park. Look, it was a job all right?' Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.' I will not take this abuse. You're right, I'm sorry. \" Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy... \" You should both know, that he's a dead man. Oh, Chandler? So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I ca n't stop smiling. I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth. I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco? Oh, yeah. Well, it's like that. With feelings. Oh wow. Are you in trouble. Big time! Want a wedding dress? Hardly used. I think we are getting a little ahead of selves here. Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gon na get up and go to work. Oh, look, wish me luck! What for? I'm gon na go get one of those job things. \n","Hey, Monica! Hey Frannie, welcome back! How was Florida? You had sex, did n't you? How do you do that? Oh, I hate you, I'm pushing my Aunt Roz through Parrot Jungle and you're having sex! So? Who? You know Paul? Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul. You mean you know Paul like I know Paul? Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years. \n","What you guys do n't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. Yeah, right!....... Y'serious? Oh, yeah! Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. Absolutely. Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand - up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. Yeah, and - and it's not that we do n't like the comedian, it's that - that... that's not why we bought the ticket. The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. Yeah, well, word of advice : Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gon na find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone..... Are we still talking about sex? \n","No, it's good, it is good, it's just that - mm - does n't Woman 1 seem a little angry? Well, she has issues. Does Woman 1. Man 1's out banging other women over the head with a club, while Woman 1 sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet! Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like' Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See? Speaking of issues, is n't that your ex-wife? No. No. Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! Okay, okay, yes, it is. How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age. Hi. So. You look great. I, uh... I hate that. Sorry. You look good too. Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh... A lesbian? Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family? Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh - Why - why are you here, Carol? I'm pregnant. Pregnant?! \n","Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.... Then I've already seen this one! Are you through with that? Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down. Whose little ball of paper is this?! Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I did n't need it, so I balled it up and...... now I wish I was dead. Monica Geller's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that - - but, it's fine! Look, I'm sorry, guys, I just do n't wan na give them any more ammunition than they already have. Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow. Monica - Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not - not in a good way. Yeah, calm down. You do n't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come. That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew! What? Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster! Eeaagh! Has anybody seen my engagement ring? Yeah, it's beautiful. Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... No, look, do n't touch that! Oh, like I was n't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him...' Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gon na have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder... Easy Rach, we'll find it. Wo n't we! Oh! Yeah! Alright, when'd'ya have it on last? Doy! Probably right before she lost it! You do n't get a lot of' doy' these days... I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...... Dinah? Ohhhhh, do n't be mad... You did n't. Oh, I am sorry... I gave you one job! Oh, but look how straight those noodles are! Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne... I just... ca n't do it. Boys? We're going in...... Hi. Wow. That is not a happy hi. Carol's pregnant. Ooh! I found it! W - w - wh -... wha -... w - w - w -... Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon? Well now, how - how do you fit into this whole thing? Well, Carol says Carol Willick and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I do n't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me. Carol Willick is so great! I miss Carol Willick. What does she mean by' involved'? I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done. Anyway, they want me to go down to this - sonogram thing with them tomorrow. So what are you gon na do? I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gon na be a father...... Well, this is still ruined, right? \n","Your folks are really that bad, huh? Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done. Boy, I know they say you ca n't change your parents,... boy, if you could - - I'd want yours. Must pee. Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins. You're twins? Yeah. We do n't speak. Ursula's like this high - powered, driven career type. What does Ursula do? Ursula's a waitress. All right, you guys, I kinda got ta clean up now. Chandler, you're an only child, right? You do n't have any of this. Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred. The lights, please..... How long was I in there? I'm just cleaning up. D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help? Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! Anyway.. um.. So, you - uh - you nervous about Barry tomorrow? Oh.. a little.. Mm-hmm.. A lot. Mm. So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been - dumped? Well, you may wan na steer clear of the word' dumped'. Chances are Barry's gon na be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB / GYN... Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated? Got me. Remember when we were in high school together? Yeah. I mean, did n't you think you were just gon na meet somone, fall in love - and that'd be it?.. Ross? Yes, yes! Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. Me either... \n","Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway. Hi. Ross, you remember Susan. How could I forget? Ross. Hello, Susan. Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...? Dr. Oberman... Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is Dr. Oberman - She. - Dr. Oberman, of course, Dr. Oberman - uh - familiar with our.. special situation? Yes, and she's very supportive. Okay, that's great. No, I'm - Oh. Thanks. Quack, quack.. Ross? That opens my cervix. \n","So, um - so how's this, uh, how's this gon na work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made? Give me a' for instance'. Well, uh, uh, I do n't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name? Marlon - Marlon?! - if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.... As in Mouse? As in my grandmother. Still, you - you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia? Julia.. We agreed on Minnie.' S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..? \n","Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to? Oh, not much. I - I got a job. Oh, that's great. Why are - why are you so tanned? Oh, I, uh - I went to Aruba. Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone? No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt. Me?! No! I went with Mindy. Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?! Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. Oh! Well, um.. You've got plugs! Careful! They have n't quite taken yet. And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye! Not for Mindy. Listen, I really wanted to thank you. Okay.. See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. Wow. You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We were n't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit. What? Me. Anyway, um, I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me. Well, thank you for giving it back. Hello?! \n","Hi guys! Hey, Pheebs! Hi! Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? Um, not so good. Phoebe's boyfriend walked me to the subway and said' We should do this again!' Ohh. Ouch. What? He said' we should do it again', that's good, right? Uh, no. Loosely translated' We should do this again' means' You will never see me naked'. Since when? Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like' It's not you' means' It is you'. Or' You're such a nice guy' means' I'm gon na be dating leather - wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. Or, or, y'know, um,' I think we should see other people' means' Ha, ha, I already am'. And everybody knows this? Yeah. Cushions the blow. Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm. That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm. Uh, Ross. What? Wh - hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was - it w -..... Oh my God, Chi Chi! \n","\" So how does it feel knowing you're about to die? \" \" Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over.

Luckily none of the bullets hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I -... I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories. Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it. We talked' til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.... All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. Oh, I'm sorry, so' we' is?' We' would be me and Rick. Who's Rick? Who's Rick? My husband. Ooooohhh. Oh, so you're divorced? No. Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?... Hopefully? No, I'm still married. So tell me, how do - how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?... Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket? Do n't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, Rick's okay with Ethan. Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan? Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend. What?! So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend? I suppose mainly sexual.... Hm. Oh. I'm sorry it did n't work out. What' not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Did n't you listen to the story? Did n't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this? Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff : all the fun, all the talking, all the sex ; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy! Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy? No, of course not!... Yeah, yeah, it is. What? So you guys do n't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else? I could n't do it. Good for you, Joey. When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is. Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking - Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know. We're kidding. C'mon, tell us! Yeah! C'mon! Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey - \n","Alright, alright, alright... Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer. For what? Whaddya think? Today's the big day! Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just do n't ever tell me what you did in there. Thank you! Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone. Joey Tribbiani's in the bathroom. I do n't think you wan na go in there! C'mon, we're roommates! My eyes!! My eyes!! I warned you... Who is being loud? Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wan na borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wan na make her breakfast. Oh, you got the whole night, huh? Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment? No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it.' Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every - single - second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty - five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the - the old Monica would - would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush... But I'm not gon na do that. \n","... Dammit, hire the girl! Okay, everybody ready? Uh, listen, I just wan na thank you for this great opportunity. Lose the robe. Me? That would work. Right. Okay. Losing the robe. And the robe is lost. Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working.. and... action. And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing? Well, I'm - I'm showering. No, that was clenching. Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here. I think his butt would like to get this shot before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action.... and cut. What was that? I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask... \n","God, I love these fingers... Thank you. No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at' em, look at how happy they are. Oh my God, I'm late. Oh no nonononononnononono, do n't go.. Okay. Do n't go. Okay. Oh no, I have to. Too bad, Aurora's leaving. I'm sorry. Andrew'll be waiting for me. Well, I thought - I thought you talked to Rick. It's not Rick. What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you! No, it's - it's Andrew. I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but - And Andrew is? Andrew's... new. Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself? No, that's not exactly what I was.. Well, y'know, most women would kill for three guys like us. So what do you want? You. You have me! Nono, just you. Whaddyou mean? Lose the other guys.... Like,... all of them? C'mon, we're great together, why not? Why ca n't we just have what we have now? Why ca n't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too.... Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going' Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And Chandler Bing's saying, y'know,' This is too hard! Get out! Get out!' So... which one of the two guys will you listen to? I do n't know, I - I have to listen to both of them, they do n't exactly let each other finish... Which one?... The second guy. Well, call me if you change your mind. Sorry, the first guy runs the lips. \n","Look at it this way : you dumped Aurora. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again? Hey! Hey, waitwait, are n't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie? Nope. No? What happened, big guy? \" Big guy? \" It felt like a' big guy' moment. I got fired. Oh! Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gon na go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and... Oh, Joey, you know what, no - one is gon na be able to tell. My mom will. Something so sweet and... disturbing about that. Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my shot, and I blow it! Maybe this was n't your shot. Yeah, I mean... I think when it's your shot, y'know, you - you know it's your shot. Did it... feel like your shot..? Hard to tell, I was naked. No, I do n't think this was your shot. I mean, I do n't even think you just get one shot. I really believe big things are gon na happen for you, I do! You've got ta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gon na run up to his friends and go' I got the part! I got the part! I'm gon na be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'. Yeah? That's so nice! I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gon na go to bed, guys. Night. Uh, Mon, you - you gon na leave your shoes out here? Uh-huh! Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner? Does n't matter, I'll get' em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. She is a kook. \n","Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre. Hi Mom, it's Jill. Jill's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre! Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot! Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule. Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule. I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I do n't know, some guy. Oh! Some guy. Some guy.' Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, Chandler Bing was some guy. \n","Alright, somebody. OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table. Whoooaa! That's my sister. OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library. Oh my God! What were you doing in a library? Pheebs, what about you? Oh... Milwaukee. Um... Ross? Disneyland, 1989,' It's a Small World After All.' No way! The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom. Oh, Rachel. Oh come on, I already went. You did not go! Come on. Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be...... oh, the foot of the bed. Step back. We have a winner! I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park. Well, it was the only thing to do there that did n't have a line. There, well, see? Barry would n't even kiss me on a miniature golf course. Come on. No, Barry said we were holding up the people behind us. And you did n't marry Barry because...? I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of... Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated. Yeah right. It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff. OK. But, um... I do n't think that's going to be you. You do n't. Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future. Really? Mmmm. You do? I do. Oh Ross, you're so great. It's never gon na happen. What? You and Rachel. What? Why not? Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone. No, no, no. I'm not in the zone. Ross, you're mayor of the zone. I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to... Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you do n't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever. I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment. What? What, now? Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say,' Rachel, I think that...' Shhhh! What are you shushing? We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen. Do n't you hear that? Ahhhh! See? Huh. \n","New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary,'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... OK, here goes. Are you going to do it? I'm going to do it. Do you want any help? You come out there, you're a dead man. Good luck, man. Thanks. OK. OK. Hey, where are you going? Outside. You ca n't go out there. Why not? Because of... the reason. And that would be? I, um, ca n't tell you. Joey, what's going on? OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you. About what? He's planning your birthday party. Oh my God! I love him! You'd better act surprised. About what? My surprise party! What surprise party? Oh stop it. Joey already told me. Well, he did n't tell me. Hey, do n't look at me. This is Ross's thing. This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything. No, you are not. We tell you stuff. Yuh - huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when Joey Tribbiani was moving in. Looks like I was second to last. \n","Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right? Oh. Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner. Er, yeah, it's mine. He seems to hate you. Are you sure? Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat. Wait a minute. What's his name? Ehhhh... B - Buttons. Bob Buttons? Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons. Oooh! You are a very bad man! You owe me a cat. \n","Lucky sixes.... Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica. Hi! And Joey.... Hi! And Ross. Hi! He does n't speak much English. Monopoly! Look at that! So, um... where did Paolo come from? Oh... Italy, I think. No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives. Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat! That, that is funny....... and Rachel keeps touching him. Alright. I looked all over the building and I could n't find the kitty anywhere. Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat. Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo. Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe. You betcha! \n","Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this? Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said' co - dependent', or' self - destructive'... Do you want a date Saturday? Yes please. Okay. He's cute, Man 1's funny, Man 1's - He's a he? Well yeah!... Oh God. I - just - I thought - Good, Shelley. I'm just gon na go flush myself down the toilet now... Okay, goodbye... \n","... Could n't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe Shelley actually thought that? Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... You did? Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not. Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me? I did. Yeah, I think so, yeah. Not me. Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did. You're kidding! Did you tell her I was n't? No. No, it's just' cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked Susan Sallidor, so... Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me? I du n no,'cause you're smart, you're funny... Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him? Yeah! Right! WHAT IS IT?! Okay, I - I d'know, you - you just - you have a quality. Yes. Absolutely. A quality. Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gon na be vague about this. Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. Oh my God! Calling from Rome! Bon giorno, caro mio. So Paolo's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just got ta go to Rome. Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome. I'm talking to Rome. Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana. \n","So, uh, how's she doing? The doctor says it's a matter of hours. How - how are you, Mom? Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here.... What's with your hair? What? What's different? Nothing. Oh, maybe that's it. Mrs. Geller is unbelievable, our mother is... Okay, relax, relax. We are gon na be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover. Oh God! The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. Oh!... Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Ross' grandmother Sweet' n' Los. How she was always stealing them from - from restaurants. Not just restaurants, from our house. Mrs. Geller? She looks so small. I know. Well, at least Ross' grandmother's with Pop - Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. G'bye, Nana. Bye, Nana. Ross! What is going on?! Y'know how - how the nurse said that - that Nana had passed? Well, Ross' grandmother's not, quite.. What? Ross' grandmother's not - past, she's present, Ross' grandmother's back. What's going on? Ross' grandmother may have died. Ross' grandmother may have died? We're looking into it. I, uh, I'll go see. This almost never happens! Now Ross' grandmother's passed. \n","I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair? Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair. Yeah, you have homosexual hair. So, um, did Ross' date... Twice. Twice? Oh, that sucks! You guys okay? I du n no, it's weird. I mean, I know Ross' date's gone, but I just do n't feel, uh... Maybe that's'cause she's not really gone. Nono, Ross' date's gone. We checked. A lot. Hm, I mean maybe no - one ever really goes. Ever since my mom died, every now and then, I get the feeling that Lily Buffay's like right here, y'know? Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high - got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course - I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know?... I miss Debbie. Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? Thanks! Sure. I just sharpened her this morning. Now, see, I do n't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!... So Chandler looks gay, huh? Y'know, I du n no who this is, but it's not Debbie. \n","Hey, gorgeous. Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um - No, nono, do n't - do n't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake. Oh! Okay! Phew! So, uh... what do you think it is about me? I du n no, uh... you just have a-a...... Quality, right, great. Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple. Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with? What? Lowell's cute! Well, yeah...' s'no Brian in Payroll. Is Brian...? No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gon na set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like Brian. Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league. Excuse me? You do n't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me.... I'm really not. \n","This one? No. I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant - suit, go with the burgundy. You know, whatever we pick, Ross' grandmother would've told us it's the wrong one. You're right. We'll go with the burgundy. Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. Wait! We need shoes! Okay. Um, how about these? That's really a day shoe. And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier? Could we see something in a slimmer heel? Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the burgundy. I can show you something in a silver that may work. No, it really should be burgundy. Mm. Unless we go with a different dress? No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back. Oh my God.. Is everything all right, dear? Yeah, just... just Nana stuff. \n","It was a really beautiful service. It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart. Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream. What? Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger. Check it out, Giants - Cowboys. You're watching a football game at a funeral? No, it's the pre-game. I'm gon na watch it at the reception. You are a frightening, frightening man. Oh no! My new Paolo shoes! Oh, I hope they're not ruined. God, what a great day.... What? Weather - wise! I know, uh, the air, the - the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh - I du n no, almost life - aff - God! Ross! I'm fine. Just - just... having my worst fear realised... \n","Okay, do n't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm... huh. What, what is it? You missed a belt loop. Oh! No - n - Okay, it's in spasm. Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. Oh, no - Sorry - Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter. Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is. Hey, look who's up! How do you feel? I feel great. I feel - great, I fleel great. Wow, those pills really worked, huh? Not the first two, but the second two - woooo!... I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister, I love Pheebs... Ooh! That's so nice...... Chandler! Hey. And listen, man, if you wan na be gay, be gay. Does n't matter to me. You were right. Rachel. Rachel Rachel. I love you the most. Oh, well you know who I love the most? No. You! Oh.. you do n't get it! Whaddya got there? Just a, uh... hearing disability. What's the score? Seventeen - fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third. Beautiful! Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cracker? Your grandmother would have hated this. Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all. No, I'd be hearing about' Why did n't I get the honey - glazed ham?', I did n't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more Monica's grandmother'd be saying' Why are you wasting your money? I do n't need flowers, I'm dead'. That sounds like Nana. Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?... I can imagine. I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life - affirming person that she is. That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if Monica's grandmother was here right now, would you tell Monica's grandmother? Tell Monica's grandmother what? How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example. I'm not sure I know what you're getting at. Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told Monica's grandmother the truth?... No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. Huh. More wine, dear? Oh, I think so. Those earrings look really lovely on you. Thank you. They're yours. Actually they were Nana's. Now I'm depressed!... Even more than I was. \n","Terry, I, I, I know that I have n't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $ 100 advance in my salary? An advance? It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job. Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful. Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee? Oh, look at that. \n","Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips? Huh? Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before. Only $ 98.50 to go. Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving? No, they're not. Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them. You're wrong. I am not wrong. You're wrong. No, I just talked to them. I'm calling Mom. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. And this from the cry - for - help department. Are you wearing makeup? Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model. That's so funny,'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman. What were you modeling for? You know those posters for the city free clinic? Oh, wow, so you're gon na be one of those \" healthy, healthy, healthy guys \"? You know, the asthma guy was really cute. Do you know which one you're gon na be? No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... Good luck, man. I hope you get it. Thanks. Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving. Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's. Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps? You know, they're not actually supposed to have... I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right? Yeah. And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays. Yes, every single one of them. Phoebe, you're gon na be with your grandma? Yes, and Phoebe's grandmother boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December'cause Phoebe's grandmother's boyfriend is lunar. So you're free Thursday, then. Yeah. Oh, can I come? Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gon na make it to Vail? Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go. I thought it was $ 98.50. Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup. Well, I'm off to Carol's. Ooh, ooh! Why do n't we invite Carol Willick? Ooh, ooh. Because Carol Willick's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. \n","Hi, is uh, is Carol here? No, Carol Willick's at a faculty meeting. Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but... Susan : Come in. Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum. What's it look like? Kinda like a big face without skin. Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it. Ok. Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian. Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they do n't let you do it. Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic. Actually, I'm reading it to the baby. The uh, the baby that has n't been born yet? Would n't that mean you're... crazy? What, you do n't think they can hear sounds in there? You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it? Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice. Do you uh, do you talk about me? Yeah, yeah, all the time. Really? But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy. \n","Look, if Susan Bunch's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this. Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say. I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head. Hey, Rach, did you make your money? No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop. Rach, here's your mail. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. No, here's your mail. Thanks, you can just put it on the table. Would you just open it? Oh my god, oh, you guys are great. We all chipped in. We did? You owe me 20 bucks. Thank you. Thank you so much! Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns. Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday? All right, I'm nine years old. Oh, I hate this story. We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have -- and I remember this part vividly -- a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced. Oh my god. Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse. \n","Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together. We did? Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy. Aramis? Aramis? Yeah, right. I got ta tell you. You're the best in the business. Get out. I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back. Really? You do n't know what that means to me. Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing? Nothing. Listen, uh, you wan na go get a drink or something? Yeah. Oh. What's wrong? I just remembered, I have to do something. Oh. What? Um, leave. Wait, wait, wait! \n","Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming. What? I do n't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen. All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping. That's closer. I got the tickets! I got the tickets!

No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment. Look out, incoming pumpkin pie! Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore. Hey, Monica, I got a question. I do n't see any tater tots. That's not a question. But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I ca n't be with my family because of my disease. All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots. Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child. Ah! Ok, Mom never hit. Ok, all done. What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps! Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions. Why would we do that? Well,'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she died. Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up. Ok, good - bye you guys. Thanks for everything. Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry! The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away. The balloon? No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news.

Well, for your information, Paolo is gon na be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. Yeah, you wish! It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this Dick Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us - dinner. Yeah, okay. Alright.

Noth - I was - I was just saying to my - Could you speak up please? Sorry, I wa - I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my - in my life. And then Max said that - you said you thought Daryl Hannah.

But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well,'cause it's you. Sure. Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just got ta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it.

I'm familiar with his work, yes... Well, Paolo made a move on me. Whoa, store will be open tomorrow! More coffee over here, please! \n","Well, what happened? Well, Paolo came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. Ooooohh! My God. Are you sure? Oh yeah, I'm sure. And all of a sudden his hands were n't the problem anymore. Was it...?

Ok, thanks Pheebs Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?! Oh, I do n't make them a lot because I do n't think it's fair to the other cookies All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had. Which proves that I never lie. I guess you do n't. Paolo made a pass at me. \n","Are you okay? I need some milk. Ok, I've got milk Here you go... Oh! Better? No... oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all \" Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so... \" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed! I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one Paolo hit on!

I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me? Did you know this is n't Ma? Ronni Rappelano name's Ronni. Ronni Rappelano's a pet mortician. Sure. So how long you been... Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships? Since then?! No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I was n't always such a terrible guy.... Joe. Y'ever been in love?... I d'know. Then y'have n't. You're burning your tomatoes. You're one to talk. Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women. Oh man. Please tell me one of' em is Ma. Of course, course one of' em's Ma. What's the matter with you. \n","It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the C.I.A. That'd be cool.... This blows! I know, I mean, why ca n't parents just stay parents? Why do they have to become people? Why do they have... Why ca n't you stop staring at my breasts? What? What? Did you not get a good enough look the other day? Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw Rachel Green boobies, I think, uh, you're gon na have to show Rachel Green your peepee. Y'know, I do n't see that happening? C'mon, Ross Geller's right. Tit for tat. Well I'm not showing you my' tat.' Hello? It's Phoebe. And Rog. C'mon up. Oh, good. Rog is here. What's the matter with Rog? Yeah. Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy.

Why would I marry Carol Willick if I thought on any level thatthat Carol Willick was a lesbian? I du n no. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail. Why? Why would I why? Why? Why? Why? I do n't know. Maybe maybe low self-esteem, maybe maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you... Wait - wait, go back to that sibling thing. Well, I do n't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents. That that's ridiculous! I do n't feel guilty for Monica Geller failures! Oh! So you think I'm a failure! Is n't Roger good? Nonono, thatthat's not what I was saying... Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better! Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good! You're right! I mean you're right! It was n't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gon na catch that movie, we got ta get going. Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel,' kay? Geez, we're gon na be late, sweetie... Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon. You're welcome. Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love. Hate that guy! \n","Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want' em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose.

We'll go to a hotel. No you wo n't. No we wo n't. If you go to a hotel you'll be... doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you. You're gon na keep an eye on us? That's right, mister, and I do n't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gon na live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend. Wow. Joey Tribbiani's strict. Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni uh, you can stay in Chandler's room. Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid. C'mon, I'll show you to my room....

Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls... Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes? Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking... Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe - fitting business, did you cave? No. No. You decided to go into the out-of - work actor business. Now that was n't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say \" No thanks, I'm married. \" You really think so? Yeah. I really do. Thanks, Chandler. Get off! \n","Hi. Hi... May I help you? Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours? Okay... who are you? Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress? Oh, c'mon in.

Fasten your seatbelts, it's peepee time. Hey, Mr. Trib. Hey. Morning, dear. Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing. What's the matter with you?! I thought it was Chandler! What? What? You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing! Sorry, my my thing was in there with me. \n","Hey, Pheebs. Hey. How's it going? Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and Roger wanted me to invite you guys. So what's going on? Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. I du n no, there's just something about... Basically we just feel that he's... We hate that guy. Yeah. Hate Roger. We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay, do n't you think, maybe, though, it's just that Roger's so perceptive that it freaks you out?... No, we hate Roger. We're sorry. \n","Ma! What're you doing here? I came to give you this and this. Oww! Big ring! Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. Hold on, you - you knew? Of course I knew! What did you think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. \" I'm sleeping over at my accountant's, \" I mean, what is that? Please! So then how could you I mean, how could you?! Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made Mr. Tribbiani happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, Mr. Tribbiani has a hobby. Ma, I do n't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you? Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no Ronni Rappelano, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle - stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that Mr. Tribbiani's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary. I'm... happy... for you? Well do n't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was. Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want. I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see Ronni Rappelano? Yeah. You're ten times prettier than Ronni Rappelano is. That's sweet. Could I take Ronni Rappelano? With this ring? No contest. \n","What's wrong, sweetie? Nothing, nothing. Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They - they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they do n't. Oh. They do n't. But they do n't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They do n't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little... What? Intense and creepy. Oh. But I do n't. Me, Phoebe. Well, I'm not I'm not at all surprised they feel that way. You're not? See, that's why you're so great! Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all' Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'. \n","I'm tellin' you Ross, Woman wants you. She barely knows me. We just live in the same building. Any contact? Woman lent me an egg once. You're in! Aw, right.

I think it's insane. She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend. Think it'll work? No, it's suicide. The man's got an egg. \n","You can not do this. Do what, do what? Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night. No! Phoebes! Do n't you remember why you dumped the guy?' Cause Roger was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day! But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do. Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night? Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes. Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... No, no, no, do n't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for Joey's date friend. Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a... Pathetic mess? I know, butcome on, man, she's needy, Chandler Bing's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha - ching! Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this. Hi. She said yes. Yes! Way to go, man! Still got the egg, huh? \n","Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney. Which one was Pete Carney? Pete the Weeper?

Abby said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual. Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald. Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect. Ok, well, what kind of ritual? Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us. Or? Or... or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks. Burning's good. Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn. \n","You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes. Good for you. Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters? By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads. That's OK. Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty. We ca n't do that. What? What ca n't you do? Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there? Uh, we might be leaving now. Tell me it's \" you and me \" we. Lorraine said Lorraine wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.

Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please? I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler. I hope Lorraine throws up on you. So... Just us.

So, do we have the best friends or what? Joey's not a friend. He's... a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV? I will go for that drink. You got it.

Rach, come see who's out here! Oh my god. Janice, hi! Janice is gon na go away now. I'll be right back. Oh, Joey, look who it is. Whoa. Oh, good, Joey's home now. This is so fun.

How did you know? \n","I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he does n't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.

I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. Now that is funny. Hey, do you think... would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us?'

And, Kristin, Kristin...... does something that, funnily enough, was n't even her major! \n","I brought you something. Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts. Chan and Jan Forever. I had them made special. Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just do n't things are gon na work out.

Chandler's coming and Chandler Bing says he has, like, this incredible news, so when Chandler Bing gets here, we could all act like, you know... Hey! Hey! Never mind. But it was going to be really good. What's going on? What is it? So, it's a typical day at work. I'm inputting my numbers, and big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor. That's great! So.... I quit. Why? Why? This was supposed to be a temp job! Yeah, Chandler... you've been there for five years. If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do. So was it a lot more money? It does n't matter. I just do n't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.... the WENUS? Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term. Oh. That WENUS. So what're you going to do? I do n't know. That's the thing. I do n't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there. Oooh! I have something you can do!

Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for? Well, Steve wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu. Oh my God! Yeah, I know! So, what do you think? Thanks, Phoebe. But I just do n't really see myself in a big white hat. OK. Oh Monica! Guess what! \n","Can you see my nipples through this shirt? No. But do n't worry, I'm sure they're still there. Where are you going, Mr. Suity - Man? Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.

So great! Steve showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this, it's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right. Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears? So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for Steve Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition.

Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross. Celia name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum. So what are you guys going to do? Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring Celia back to my place and I'd introduce Celia to my monkey. And Ross Geller's not speaking metaphorically. So.... back to your place... you thinking, maybe... huh - huh? Well, I do n't know.... huh - huh.... but I'm hoping huh - huh. I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal. \n","OK, try this salmon mousse. Mmmm. Good. Is it better than the other salmon mousse? It's creamier.

Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn? \" You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation. \" That's so great!'

Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you. It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz - bouche.

But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress. Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics. You know, I do n't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in'76. Amouz - bouche? \n","Vulva? Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it was n't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling. Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times?? Shut up! It was nice. I just... I do n't think I'm the dirty - talking kind of guy, you know? What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to Celia. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me. Please be kidding. Why not? Come on! Just, just close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now. OK. I'm in my apartment....... yeah... what else? That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. Alright, look, I'll start, OK? Joey, please. Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look! Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now. Wow. Alright, now you say something. I... ahem... I really do n't think so. Come on! You like this woman, right? Yeah. You want to see her again, right? Sure.

But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility. Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo. Hey. We found her, we found the girl. What? Did you call the cops? Nope. We took Woman to lunch. Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice. What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer. Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, Woman is this astounding person, with this, with this amazing spirit. Yeah, which Woman probably stole from some cheerleader.... Take off their hats! Popes in a Volkswagen!... I love that joke. \n","No way. No way did you do this. Monana was very brave. It was so wild. We told them we were the Gunnersens in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor! So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts...... They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me! Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I do n't know. Do n't wait up. Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show.' Scuse me? There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say? Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I - I ca n't even stand in front of a tap class. Well, that's just probably'cause of your Amish background. What? Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right? Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned. I - I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society? Uh-huh. I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because Man 1 ca n't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought,' Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do. Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire. \n","Oh God. We did n't get into Scranton.

You'd think you would've known that! Y'know, you'd think I would've. Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?... Flame Boy. \n","Where exactly is your zoo? Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel? Yes. Does he, uh, fight with other animals? No - no, he's, he's very docile. Even if he were... cornered? Well I, I do n't know. Why? Uh, how is he at handling small objects? He can hold a banana, if that's what cha mean... How about a hammer, or a small blade? Why - why - why would he need a blade? Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel. He - he - he got in, he - he got in to San Diego. We, we come back from our walk and the - the phone was ringing...... He's in. He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego! You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains. \n","Yo - hooo! Where the hell've you been?

I'm helping out down at the N.Y.U. Med School with some... research. What kind of research? Oh, just, y'know.... science. Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that.... It's a fertility study. Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time. Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars. Hey. Wow, ooh, you're gon na be making money hand over fist! \n","I mean, this is unbelievable. I know. This is really, really huge. No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee. Nuh - uh. I do n't think any of our lives are ever gon na be the same ever again. OK, is there a mute button on this woman? I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D - did you have any idea? No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W - well, what else did Ross Geller say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me? Well, given that Ross Geller's desperately in love with you, he probably would n't mind getting a cup of coffee or something. Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. H - Ross Geller's in China! The country. No, no, wait. His flight does n't leave for another forty - five more minutes. What about the time difference? From here to the airport? Yes! You're never gon na make it! Rachel, what're you gon na say to him? I-I-I do n't know. Well then maybe you should n't go. He's right, cause if you're just gon na, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait. Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell Ross Geller now. I do n't know. Maybe I'll know when I see Ross Geller. Here, look, alright, does this help? Noooo... look, all I know is that I can not wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just got ta talk to Ross Geller. I... I got ta... OK, I'll see you later. Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! \n","Alright! Ni - chou chi - ma! Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me.... Hi! Hi. May I see your boarding pass? Oh, no, no, I do n't have one. I just need to talk to my friend. Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass. No, I know, but Ihe just went on. Ross Geller's right there, Ross Geller's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j - just... No no no! Federal regulations! OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important. Alright. What's the message? Uh... I do n't know. Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you. What? It's from Rachel. Rachel Green said that Rachel Green loved the present, and Rachel Green will see you when you get back. : Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I do n't know what Flight Attendant's talking about! There's no Rachel! Do n't give me that deep freeze. \n","Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute! Heh, heh. It was nothin'. Well, now we've got ta find something fun for you! Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn. M - Me again? Sure! Why not? Boy, somebody's gon na get a big fruit basket tomorrow. Oooh, I got ta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be. How do you mean? I do n't know, I - I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always' me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman. \n","Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wan na save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gon na go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out? I do n't know. I do n't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross. Sure. I do n't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great. Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends - in - law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about Ross Geller! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date! Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date. Another good point. No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed. Huh? Well, I mean, then what happens if it does n't work out? Why is n't it working out? I do n't know... sometimes it does n't. Is he not cute enough for you? No! Does Ross Geller not make enough money? No, I'm just.... Maybe there's someone else. Wha... Is there? Is there someone else? No! There is.. there is noone else! Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!? \n","Hey, big... Shhhh!... spender. Melanie's still asleep. So how'd it go? Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed? The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me. Well, it's like, last night, I could n't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade! Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route. It was amazing! And not just for Melanie... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level. I did n't know you had another level. I know! Neither did I! \n","Hey, great skirt! Birthday present? Yeah. Oh, from who? From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me. Well, it's the thought. Hey, does n't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27 - B? Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided thisthis whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea. Oh, why? Because, I feel like I would n't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I do n't wan na... No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure! Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so... I am not' so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise. Who is it? It's me, Carl. C'mon up. Behind my brother's back?... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you wo n't be hearing from me. \n","Seven hundred bucks! Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit? Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something. Really? So, you're gon na stick with this' it's all for her' thing? What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? \n","Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell Rachel Green, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \" forget about Rachel Green \" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \" Oh my god. \" So Rachel Green went to the airport to meet Ross Geller when Ross Geller came back, but what Rachel Green did n't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been? \n","Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Move! Move! Emergency! Excuse me! Rach! Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you? It was, it was great. Oh, what happened? What? You're bleeding. I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. Come on. I wan na hear everything! Everything. Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel. These are, these are n't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country. Thank you. I'm from New York. Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok. \n","No way! I'm telling you, Rachel Green went to the airport, and Rachel Green's gon na go for it with Ross! Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge? Um, this? Yes. Guys, you got your hair cut. Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay.' Cause, you know, if you do n't look good, we do n't look good. I love that voice. Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around Julie. Cramp, cramp. Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs. You, you, you said Ross Geller liked me. You, you slowpokes! That's all right, Rach, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica. This is Chandler. Phoebe. Joey, what up? What up?! Everyone, this is Julie. Julie. Ohh. Hi! Hi, but I'm not here, you have n't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I do n't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me. And bus. Oh my god. The screaming guy? And the spitting? You got ta hear this story. We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old... 200 at least.... and this guy... And the chicken pooped in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, did n't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about. This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen? Well, Ross and I were in grad school together. But we have n't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig. Julie! Julie, is n't that great? I mean, is n't that just kick - you - in - the - crotch, spit - on - your - neck fantastic? It's an expression. Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gon na go see the baby. And then we've got ta get some sleep. Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time. Well, listen, do n't tell us what's gon na happen though,'cause I like to be surprised. Bye. \n","Hey, Rach, can I get some coffee? Yeah, sure. Thank you. Hey, Rach, can I get... Did you talk to Ross Geller? Not yet. Then, no. So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know. I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gon na happen, move on. You know whose voice that was? God? It was you, pal. Well, maybe it was God, doing me. Look, you were right. Rachel Green looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I do n't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with Julie if it had n't been for you. Well, you owe me one, big guy. Here's your lemonade. I did n't order lemonade. Oh. Well then, you better go take that back because they're gon na charge you for that. But... Go - go - go - go, come on! So uh, what did you find out? He said... he said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wan na see it, is that he made the decision all by himself! Without any outside help whatsoever. How is that the silver lining? You have to really wan na see it. \n","Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym. Pheebes, you know what I'm thinking? Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it? No, although now that's what I'm thinking. All right, so what were you thinking? Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine? Ohh! No. Why not? Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak. No you're not. I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings. Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie, for you. Hello? Hi. Hi. Anybody know a good tailor? Needs some clothes altered? No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk. Why do n't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. Frankie did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No,' scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990? Okay. You have to stop the Q - tip when there's resistance! Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you did n't hang up either. Julie did n't hang up either! Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y... Sorry, I thought you were talking to me. Rachel! I'll just call her back. Okay! Hi? Sorry, we got disconnected... Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now Ross Geller's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I ca n't have. Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too. I know you did. I'm just gon na deal with it, I'm just gon na deal with it. I got ta get out of here. Ok, I do n't care what you guys say, something's bothering Rachel Green. \n","Ok, Paulo, why do n't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye - bye. Rachel, how did this happen? I do n't know, I just kinda ran into Paulo last night. Where? At his apartment. Is this juice? Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped Paulo because Paulo hit on Phoebe? Oh God, I know I'm a pathetic loser. Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad. People do stupid things when they're upset. My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I had n't..., but this is about your horrible mistake. Hi! Hi. Sorry we're late but we werewell, there was touching. Hey, hey Ross. Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here? I do Raquel. So, uh, he's back. Yeah, Paulo's back. Is that a problem? No, not a problem. Good! I'm glad it's not a problem. Ok, you're gon na have to not touch my ass. Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered. Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell Frankie Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means. Are you sure Frankie's gon na be able to crack that code? You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter. All right. Ok, but, but! You have to promise that you will not be all like control - y and bossy and Monica about it. I promise. All right. Now some of you are gon na get cut, and some of you are n't. But I promise none of you are gon na feel a thing. \n","All right, that's it, I quit. What? I did n't say anything. Yeah, but this is n't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, does n't trust a person. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed. Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it. How who wears it? Demi Moore. Demi Moore is not a he. Well, Dudley Moore was a he in Arthur, and in Ten. That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore. Oh. Oh! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore? Demi Moore's the actress that was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost! Oh, Demi Moore's got gorgeous hair. I know! \n","Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gon na grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I could n't resist. Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my God, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him? Oh, is Ben hungry already? I guess so. You know, it's... something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back. I got ta get one, too. What are you guys doing? We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle? Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world. Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it. This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gon na happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on. Carol? Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast - feeding? Sure. Uh, does it hurt? It did at first, but not anymore. Chandler? So, uh, how often can you do it? As much as Ben needs. Ok, I got one, I got one. Uh, if he blows into one, does the other one get bigger? \n","Rachel, do you have any muffins left? Yeah, I forget which ones. Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? No thanks. Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go. Thank you. What a bitch. Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdale's who's quitting tomorrow and Julie's friend wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it? I ca n't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet. Ok, um, I'll go with you. Great. Hi, honey. Hey, sweetums. Hello to the rest. Hi! Monica what're you doin'? You ca n't go shopping with Julie? What about Rachel? It's gon na be a problem, is n't it? Come on, you're going to Bloomingdale's with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in Rachel Green house of worship. But I'm... Monica, Rachel Green will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street. So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow? Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal. It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this. You're welcome. Woof, woof. \n","Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle. Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy? Who? Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man. Hombre? What's he doin' in my section? I guess Hombre Man does n't know. Well, Hombre Man's gon na. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'? Mornin'. Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory. Your territory, huh? Yeah. Bijan for men? No thanks. Hombre? Yeah. All right. You were saying? \n","Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he wo n't sleep. Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son. Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Do n't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person. Oh, this is so cute. Oh, I got that for Ben. My mommies love me. That's clever. Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye. Did you just say Hi, Jew? Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith. \n","Ben, dinner! Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you did n't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that. Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok. What did you just do? I licked my arm, what? It's breast milk. So? Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person. What is the big deal? What did you just do? Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk? You wo n't even taste it? No! Not even if you just pretend that it's milk? Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it. \n","Hey, where is everybody? They took Ben to the park. Where've you been? Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket. Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Okay. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars? You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card. And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket? That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent. Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with? Judy. Who? Julie. What?! Jody! You were with Julie? Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to Julie because Julie was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were... shopping. Oh. Oh my God. Honey, wait. We only did it once. It did n't mean anything to me. Yeah, right. Sure! Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out! Oh, please, you wanted to get caught. That is not true! Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here? Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid? Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with Julie to Bloomingdale's? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now. \n","Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanne, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I do n't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve. Hey! How did we do? Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out. I did not freak out. Why'd you freak out? Because it's breast milk. It's gross. My breast milk is gross? This should be fun. No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just, I just do n't think breast milk is for adults. Of course the packaging does appeal to grown - ups and kids alike. Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. That would be no. Come on. It does n't taste bad. Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh... Cantaloupe juice. Exactly. You've tasted it? You've tasted it. Uh huh. Oh, you've tasted it. You can keep saying it, but it wo n't stop being true. Gim me the bottle. Gim me the towel. \n","Howdy. Gim me a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre. Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed. Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wan na put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day. What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This is n't supposed to mean anything to you. I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I do n't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese. All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gon na come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gon na run? Yeah I guess you're right. You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie. I'm gon na do it. All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker. \n","I do n't know what else to say. Well that works out good, because I'm not listening. I feel terrible, I really do. Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your knife? Rachel, say that I'm friends with Julie, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible? Yes. It's that terrible? Yes. Monica, you do n't get it. It's bad enough that Julie's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, Julie's actually, but now she's actually stealing you. Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with Julie does n't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my... We're, we're... Oh, I love you. I love you too. You guys, um I know that this really does n't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that. Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but Julie did n't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave Julie a chance, you'd like Julie. Would you just give that a chance, for me? I'd do anything for you, you know that. I'd do anything for you. Wait, wait, wait, wait! \n","Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I got ta go, I got ta go, I got ta go. OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gon na get a pot, it's not for you. OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy.

Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here? Uh, no Phoebe Buffay does n't but I can, I can get a message to Phoebe Buffay. Great. Uhh, just tell her Phoebe Buffay husband stopped by. What? Hey, how, how did you do that? \n","This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married? Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and Duncan's gay and Duncan's just from Canada and Duncan just needed a green card. I ca n't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything. I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve. Of course I would n't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? You see, and you thought Monica Geller'd be judgemental. OK, I was n't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend. Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger. Huuh. Well, did n't you? I might have. I ca n't believe you did n't tell me. Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything. What have I not told you? Oh, I do n't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace. What! Wait a minute, who told you? You are dead meat. I did n't know it was a big secret. Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I do n't know, having a third nipple. You have a third nipple? You bitch. Whip it out, whip it out. C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless. Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples? I ca n't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin. Joey, what did you think a nubbin was? I do n't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again. Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin. Joey was in a porno movie. Huuh. If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me. You were in a porno? Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I could n't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but ca n't'cause there's people havin' sex on it. That is wild. So what's it shaped like? Yeah, is there a hair on it? What happens if you flick it? \n","So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special? Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia. You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you. Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area? You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you do n't know? Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special. Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But Ross Geller's with Julie now and you're just gon na have to get over it. Ohh, I'm gon na have to get over it. God, see I did n't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it. Woah. Foxy lady. Where you goin'? Um, I'm gon na go meet Duncan, Duncan's skating tonight at the Garden, Duncan's in the Capades. The Ice Capades? No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns are n't as fast but when Snoopy falls... funny. I ca n't believe you're dressing up for Duncan. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again. OK, no. For your information I'm going to see Duncan so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband. Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk. Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here? Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha... \n","OK sweetie, I'll see you later. See you later Rach. Bye - bye Julie. Hey. Hey. Hey, c'mon, cut it out. Hey? What? Can I ask you somethin'? Sure. Naa. What? C'mon, talk to me. OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex? Why? Who's not having... Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex? Technically, huh, no. Wow. Is it, is it'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school? No, no, she's great and it's not like we have n't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh... No, no no no, do n't need to know the details. It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and Carol Willick turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I... Well, you just must think I'm weird. No, no, no, no I do n't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think? What? I think it's sexy. Sexy? Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex. No kidding? Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do? What? I'd wait. You'd wait? Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait... then I'd wait some more. Really? Oh yeah, I do n't care how much Julie tells you she wants it, I do n't care if begs, she pleads, Julie tells you she, she's gon na have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working. Women really want this? More than jewelry. \n","Hi. Phoebe! Ta - da. Hey. Hi. Ahh, look at you, you look great. Do I? Thank you, so do you. Thanks. Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice. You always said I'd make it. Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo.

Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright. Hi everyone. Hi. I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before. Oh, God, no problem. So you're gon na go with the uh, waiting thing? Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey. What did, what did he say? Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so... \n","What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's porno movie. Pop it in. I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see. What's wrong with people having sex? Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here. Hell, I wan na see Joey. So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right... oh, never mind. OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen. All I say is, Woman 1 better get the job.

Umm, actually, I'm getting married again. What? Oh God, I do n't know how to tell you this. I'm straight. Huuh. Yeah, I know, I. I, I do n't, I do n't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties. I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you ca n't live a lie anymore. So how long have you known? Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in. And um, and there's actually a, a woman? Debra name's Debra. Oh. Well is she, is Debra the first that you've been with? Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. Sure. But now I know I do n't have a choice about this, I was born this way. I, I do n't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says,' Oh, I'm not gay.' I'm, I'm still me. Why could n't you have just figured this out six years ago? \n","You know, it still smells like monkey in there. That saves us a conversation. Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped. Me too, we should get goin'. No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore. Rachel, that's all we do. Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie? What about Julie? Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we do n't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what do n't you like? We wan na hear everything. Well, that could take a while. So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie? I got the time to get to know Julie. I got time. Rach, I know Julie pretty well, can I go? That's fine. OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like? Well, in a nutshell... Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh. \n","Man, I sure miss Julie. Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. You ever figure out what that thing's for? No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I do n't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I do n't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did? What? I got a little drunk... and naked. Bob here. What've you been up to? Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster. Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. I love Jane. I know. I'm back. So, are we gon na get together or what? Um, absolutely. Uh, how' bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five - ish? Great, I'll see you then. Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off. Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gon na realize, \" hey, you're not Bob. \" I'm hoping that when Bob does n't show up, Jane will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table. Oh my god. You are pure evil. Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this. \n","Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico. Hi, Julie! Hi, Julie.

You know, I think I might just. So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight? Well I guess I got ta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies. Can you believe how much this is gon na cost? Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just do n't get that we do n't make as much money as they do? Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \" let's go here, let's go there \". Like we can afford to go here and there. Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it,' cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross. For Ross. For Ross, Ross, Ross. Oh my god. Hey. Hi. What? I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job. If it's not you, this is a horrible story. Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice. Yeah, someplace nice. How much do you think I can get for my kidney? I'm tellin' you. You ca n't do this. Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods. That does n't matter. Jane wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who Jane was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness. We do n't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy. Go over there and tell that woman the truth. All right. Go. Hi. Hi. Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something. Yes? Whoever stood you up is a jerk. How did you --? I do n't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue? Thanks. No, you keep the pack.

Yeah, these are pretty ch - ching. What are these, like famous chickens? Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade? Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine? Oh, see, I had to tell Jade that my number was your number, because I could n't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number. Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls? Do I dare ask? Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns. That sounds great. Same for me. And for the gentleman? Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper? You'd think, would n't you? Miss? Ok, I will have the uh, side salad. And what will that be on the side of? Uh, I do n't know. Why do n't you put it right here next to my water? And for you?

I, I just never think of money as an issue. That's'cause you have it. That's a good point. So um, how come you guys have n't talked about this before?' Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla. Wha --? Whoa, hey, I do n't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative -- there's gon na be a hoopla? Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing. If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift. G - gift? The thing's not the gift? No, the thing was, we were gon na go see Hootie and the Blowfish.

Let's take a look. Oh, it's like a skit. Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe. Whoo! Cool. Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank - you. But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope? By the way, this did n't seem so dorky in the hall. Come on. Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish! It's on us, all right, so do n't worry. It's our treat. So... Thank you. Could you be less enthused? Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like -- Like? Charity. Charity? We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here. Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big. Actually, it makes us feel that big. I do n't, I do n't understand. I mean, you, it's like we ca n't win with you guys. If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel. Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel. Ok, we never should a talked about this. I'm just gon na pass on the concert,'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now. Me neither. Me too. Guys, we bought the tickets. Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff. Why did you look at me when you said that? Well, I guess now we ca n't go. What? Come on, you do what you want to do.

I never have to answer that phone again. Here comes the beep, you know what to do. Hey, Bob, it's Jade.

Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago. So, uh, how was Chandler Bing? Eh. Eh? Oh, Bob, Chandler Bing was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name. Well, that makes me feel so good. It was just so awkward and bumpy. Bumpy? Well, maybe Chandler Bing had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.

Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food - preparation holidays : Easter, Christmas, what have you. Mmm - mmm.

I'm just a social drinker,' or,' C'mon, it's Flag Day.' So, what are you saying now? I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. Sooo, what's goin' on, huh? I am gon na try and quit drinking. Ooohh, why? Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Guess who's back in show business. Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green? No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead. Oh, no. OK, I guess this is gon na seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who. Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives! Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme. Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia. Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gon na do something tonight. Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I... I kinda got plans. You have other friends? Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date. What? With a man? What? What is so strange about me having a date? What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you? Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at Ross Geller anymore. What are you talking about? I do n't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not. But you guys came so close. Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gon na have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross. Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ. Hhhhiiiii. \n","Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya? Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later. Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition? Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday. Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic? No. Well, here it is. OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady... Oh, is n't Lori a doll? Oh yeah, yeah, Lori's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that Lori was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in. Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gon na put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out. Yeah, hi, Lori please. Hi darling. So how' bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, is n't Joey Tribbiani terrific? Uh-huuuuh. Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later. Yeah, you're gon na have to sleep with her. \n","Hey. Hey. Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you did n't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry. Well, the part's mine if I want it. Oh my God! Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady. Oh my... God? Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television. So, what're you gon na do? Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that? Well, I... I've got a pop - up book that told me everything I need to know. I've never slept with someone for a part. Well is Lori... Sorry. It's alright. Is Lori good - looking? Yeah, Lori's totally good looking. I mean, if I met Lori in a bar, or something, I'd be buying Lori breakfast. You know, after having slept with Lori. Y'know, maybe this is n't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas. I just... I just do n't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gon na look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General. Did n't you used to call it the Little Major? Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it. \n","Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wan na do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium. Dysprosium. Dysprosium? Try mendelevium. And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine - down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues. You do n't see it? You actually do n't see it? What? OK honey, you're dating Ross. No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ. Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross! Steve... sleeve! OK, noone is named Sleeve. Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing. For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark. You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful. OK, I'm gon na get some more coffee before the pinching and eye - poking begins. I know what your problem is. Oh you do, do you? Um - hum, you're jealous. Of... of what? You're jealous because I'm a real doctor. Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma. Hey, you listen. No, no, let me finish. No, let me finish. No, you let me fini... Hi. Hi. Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! \n","Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh... oh, Ben. Hi! So how did everything go? Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it. Well, we've got ta go. Ok. Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us. Oh, you and me? Uh, no, Susan and me. The other us. Ok. We're uh, we're getting married. As in, \" I now pronounce you wife and wife \" married? Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you do n't want to. Why would n't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding. Look I just thought that... No no no, I mean, hey, why should n't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I could n't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me! Is your finger caught in that chair? Mmm hmmm. Want us to go? Uh-huh. \n","This is so cool. You're actually gon na be on television. It really hit me last night. I'm gon na be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.. Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast. Yes! They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this is n't a problem for you, is it? Would it matter? Oh, you are so great! Thank you! Are you really not going? I am really not going. I do n't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married? They love each other, and they wan na celebrate that love with the people that are close with them. If you wan na call that a reason. Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor. Ross, I thought you were over this. Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? Susan Bunch's my ex-wife. If Susan Bunch were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there. Hey, if Susan Bunch were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever. Did I miss it? Did I miss it? No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself. Whoa, Mrs. Wallace's pretty. Yeah, and Mrs. Wallace's really nice too. Mrs. Wallace taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell - the - fart acting. I'm sorry, what? What? It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this. Oh, ok. There's my scene, there's my scene. \" Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon. Is she gon na be all right? I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a.. subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee. Nice! That's great! Excellent! For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something. \n","That is so good! Do it again! All right, all right. \" Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart! \" That's great. All right, I got ta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect. No no, that's me. Oh, yeah. Oh, hello. Oh, thanks. I could n't uh... Is everything ok? Um, no, huh - uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today. Oh my god. That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get. Yeah, um, Mrs. Adelman was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman. Oh, honey. Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, Mrs. Adelman probably woke up today and thought, \" ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage. \" Little did she know God was thinking, \" Ok, but that's it. \" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing Mrs. Adelman aura when Mrs. Adelman died, and when the spirit left Mrs. Adelman body, I do n't think it went very far. What do you mean? I think it went into me. \n","God, this is so hard. I ca n't decide between lamb or duck. Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks. Ok, who ordered what? Oh, I believe I had the half - drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim. Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf? Oh god. I ca n't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'. I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just do n't want Mrs. Green to think that because I did n't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know? Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of Stella Niedman and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time. Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us? I do n't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. Sit up! There she is. Mom! Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun. Pretty much. Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten. This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross. Oh hello, Ross. Hi, Mrs. Green. So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job? Oh Mom! If you did n't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink. Believe me, sometimes that happens. This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you. Really? Yes. I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer.' Course, that's before Evelyn Dermer got the lousy face lift. Now Evelyn Dermer looks like Soupy Sales. Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer? I do n't know. Who's Soupy Sales? \n","Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello. Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument. You have some life here, sweetie. I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I did n't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know? I do. You did n't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want. For... me. Well, not just for you. Well, what do you mean? I'm uh, considering leaving your father. All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts. Oh god. I think I'm gon na be sick. Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them. And you had no idea they were n't getting along? None. They did n't fight a lot? No! They did n't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems? In my day, divorce was not an option. Hey, look who's up. I just ca n't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I would n't have to worry about this. Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because Mrs. Green wants to be more like you. Well, then, you know, could n't she have just copied my haircut? You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true. That's Man 2. Damn. My mail order grandfather has n't come yet. Phoebe? Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me. Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting. Um, do you wan na sit? Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear? I do n't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me. You're saying, my wife is in you? Yeah. Ok, you do n't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around? Well, I do n't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before Mrs. Adelman died, Mrs. Adelman wanted to see everything. Everything? Everything. Whoa, that's a lot of stuff. Oh, wait, I remember, Mrs. Adelman also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time. I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head. Worth a shot, huh? \n","Hi. How's it going? It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers. Fine, whatever. What's the matter? Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding. What? You're still gon na pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish. Carol, what's the matter? What happened? My parents called this afternoon to say they were n't coming. Oh my god. I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything. It's ok. I'm sorry. And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and Susan Bunch said we were n't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I could n't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I do n't know what to do. I uh ca n't believe I'm gon na say this, but I think Susan's right. You do? Look, do you love her? And you do n't have to be too emphatic about this. Of course I do. Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide ca n't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents did n't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it. You're right. Of course you're right. So we're back on? We're back on. You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I ca n't believe I lost 2 minutes. \n","It just seems so futile, you know? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I can not fly. Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding. Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later. Thank you. Any time. Ross. You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony. Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! Whoa, Mrs. Adelman's gone. Mrs. Adelman's gone. Mrs. Adelman's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go. \n","Would you look at them? Yeah, ca n't help but. How's that pig - in - the - blanket workin' out for you? I wrapped those bad boys. I miss Rose. Oh, yeah? I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone. You know, I uh, I could n't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life... how' bout we go get you a drink? Ok, that's so nice. I should n't even bother coming up with a line, right? Hey, Mom? Having fun? Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wan na pursue, but it's nice to know I have options. There's more alcohol, right? \n","That commercial always makes me so sad. Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK. I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel. I can see that,'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin. And the fact that they're both monkeys. Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away. Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding. Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it. Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat... all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem. \n","Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got. Rhythm? No, my first fan mail. Alright!' Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh.' Your not - so - secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait,' PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.' Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married. This was n't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building. Oh my god, I got my very own stalker. Hey guys. Hey. Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake? Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel. You know I think he will be surprised,' till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, is n't capable of that emotion. Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again. Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now. I know, I know. Hello. Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen. Hi Rob Dohnen. I do n't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great. Oh, wow. Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids? Oh, I would love to have kids... you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them. \n","Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question. Well, I uh, I ca n't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel. Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on. Oh my God, what happened? Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he died. I ca n't believe this. I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying,' Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today. Well, ya know, someone should have called me. I'm sorry. Look, I know this ca n't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture. Zoo dollars? Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey has n't just died. \n","Ooohhh. I know. I ca n't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i -, what is Erica Ford like. Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery? Yeah. Well, Erica Ford looks the exact opposite of that. And Erica Ford's not crazy? Oh no no no, Erica Ford's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore. Oh my God. Ah, and I mean, Joey Tribbiani's going out with Erica Ford? He can not persue this. Hey, just because this woman thinks Erica Ford can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room does n't mean Erica Ford's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does Erica Ford not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? Joey Tribbiani's the one who wants to boff the maniac. You OK? No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear. That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired. I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown - ups. Ya know, they just, grown - ups drink their coffee and do their grown - up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility.

Yeah it is... what? Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord. Yeah, that was a tricky one.

Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them... but I wo n't. Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life - giving hands.

Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore. \n","I do n't understand, why did n't you help that man? Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something. No, no no no, you do n't have to tell me anything. You do n't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore? But that's what... I should just be happy to be near you. Hey I - Hey what? That's it, just hey.

How did you know there was a but? I sense these things. It was either but or butter. The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals. I can do that. Really? Yeah. Because that would be fantastic. What? You wan na kiss me? Thinkin' about it. \n","Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe. Buddy, my monkey? Oh, yeah, right. There was a break - in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken. Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead. The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya? That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me. Of course they're gon na say he's dead. They do n't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover - up.

So you do n't miss the beginning. No, see this is n't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind. You go girl. I ca n't pull that off can I? Excuse me, your, your, your wind? Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you wo n't let me blow? You, you know I, I do n't, have a - have a problem with that. Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now.

Well then tell me things like,' Joey you'll be fine,' and,' Hang in there,' and, and,' Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.' But I do n't know it. What I do know is that you owe $ 2300 at Is n't it Chromantic. Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe. Ok, well then get some sense.

Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go. Ok. Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok. I do n't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gon na happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there? \n","Hey pal. Ahhhh - gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here? Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic! Look Eddie, are n't you forgetting anything? Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one. Maybe'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, is n't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now? Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac! Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time... Ah - ah - ah, you know what that is? Your last roommate's kidney? That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display. \n","Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here.

I uh, I got ta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean do n't you think? This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue. Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff. But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack! You want some help. No help required Chico. \n","All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gon na cost you about so bucks. Excuse me, that's 50 bucks. What? Five oh dollars. Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. That's great. And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims'cause I have a background in medical acting. Ok, listen, thanks for coming in. No no, uh, do n't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge.

Looks like I'm gon na be going to the goddess meetings alone. Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after Jason Hurley broke up with Monica. One hour? You are such a leaf blower. \n","Hey. Watcha guys doin? Monica's making us watch Old Yeller. Why are you guys so upset? It's Old Yeller, it's a happy movie. What? What're you talkin' about? C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun. Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end? What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy? That's not the end. Yu - huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say' The end'. What about the part where he has rabies? He does n't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said. Uh, Phoebe, I do n't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen. What, what's about to happen? I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that gun?

Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?' Ok. Hey, why do n't you ask Richard? Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick? Wow.

I do n't know. C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and Richard's always minty fresh. I do n't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we do n't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old - er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings. So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean Richard's important to me. Ya know if you ask Richard, Richard might take you on his Jag. How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car? Ok, this could be tough. Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring Richard, but only if Richard takes the Jaguar. Ooh, you almost had it. \n","No no, you're fine, you're fine. Hello Hi. Hey. Hi honey. Oh you guys are not gon na believe what happened. What? What?

Joey, do you know we can see you from here? How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me? Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula.

Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby. What? What? You think about stuff like that? Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies. Two, two babies? Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here wo n't feel too competitive. Then what's gon na happen? Well, we wo n't wan na raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale. Uh-huh. Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we do n't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great. Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what. Huh?

You know, I do n't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed. Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but do n't you think the ending was pretty wonderful? I did n't watch the ending, I was too depressed.

Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper. Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper. Why not Shannon Cooper? Cause Shannon Cooper uh, she steals stuff. Or maybe Shannon Cooper does n't steal stuff and Joey just slept with Shannon Cooper and never called her back. Joey that is horriable. Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I do n't know I guess I just got scared. I'm sorry, I did n't know. I did n't think anyone'd buy that, ok. Hi honey, how did it go? Agh, it was the graduation from hell. Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship. Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica. So what happened? My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours. Ok, so I guess we do n't invite her parents. Well, how bout just her mom? Why her mom? Cause I already invited her. Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth? Oh no, ca n't invite Stacy Roth. Stacy Roth also steals. \n","Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake? Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan. Excuse me?

Well, my goodness, what was that? Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just were n't ready for you yet. You thought I was Rachel? Yes because uh, you look so young. And because you're both, you know, white women. Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom? NO! No, I'll take that for ya. Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you.

Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed. Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July. Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other? It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just... I, I know. \n","Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left. Oh, I ordered mine first.

Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man? No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together.

Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town? Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown. What're you doing? Just waiting for you sweetie. Are you remaking the bed? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine. Then, you're redoing it because... If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy.

Your face could be covered with lochs, I would n't care. And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me... Oh, I am scary. Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely. I hate this.'

Wait, does he eat chalk? Just,' cause, I do n't want her to go through what I went through with Carl - oh! Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and - not having sex. Sounds like a date to me. Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked. Oh, yeah. Had that dream. Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there. Instead of...? That's right. Never had that dream. No. All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I do n't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. And they were n't looking at you before?! Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very - very weird, because - she never calls me! Hi. This guy says hello, I wan na kill myself. Are you okay, sweetie? I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck... Cookie? Carol moved her stuff out today. Ohh. Let me get you some coffee. Thanks. Ooh! Oh! No, no do n't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? Fine! Be murky!

Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? Carol Willick did n't know, how should I know? Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud? I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well. Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \" I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren. \" was what? A wrong number? Sorry. Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is? Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones! I do n't want to be single, okay? I just... I just - I just wan na be married again! And I just want a million dollars! Rachel?! Oh God Monica hi! Thank God!

Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and - you remember my brother Ross? Hi, sure! Hi. So you wan na tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids? Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden - Sweet' n' Lo? - I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me : how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering' Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just did n't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city. Who was n't invited to the wedding.
